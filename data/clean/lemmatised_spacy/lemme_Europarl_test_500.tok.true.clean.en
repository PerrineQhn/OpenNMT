just so .
Kigali - and this be official - have propose organize repatriation operation jointly with the FDL , through direct financing by donor , thereby relegate the international community and the HCR to the rank of mere observer .
in reply to Mrs Riera , I think that a great deal still need to be do .
nevertheless , our view be that , in the current climate of relation , the prospect for progress be better now than under the Council ’ s previous policy , which lead u up a blind alley , a do , to say the least , the policy which for decade insist on sanction and an embargo .
the proposal be then adopt by the Council of Ministers in July 1996 .
indeed , if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy , we may wonder what industrial sector Europe will still have .
this be a good description of the present Council proposal .
firstly , the proposal for the legal provision will obviously need to bear in mind the international obligation .

( the President cut off the speaker )
it be essential that the supremacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted , the rule of law must be see to prevail and to be effectively police in an impartial manner .
I sincerely trust that the Florence Council will not degenerate into squabble over mad cow disease , but that it will produce a sign of hope that social dialogue , the originality of your proposal , of your pact of confidence , will prevail over squabble which threaten to damage public confidence in the European idea .
however , now be not the time to discuss how much progress have be make in resolve the problem of Kaliningrad or Ignalina or anything else .

when the EU & apos ; s guarantee in respect of the European Investment Bank be renew and extend to cover more country than before , it be the European Parliament & apos ; s view that the decision should come under the codecision procedure and , furthermore , fall within the competence of the European Parliament , and not just that of the Council .
it be therefore urgent , lady and gentleman , that this initiative , which we have be discuss for several month , should become reality a soon a possible .
we wish , however , to place the emphasis on the legal framework for the election , a well a freedom for the medium and the condition under which the campaign of the different political party must be carry out .

that be where they be seek security in the face of threat !
at the same time , you fail to address the European tendering rule that be throttle the small and medium-size company .

for those who learn nothing from the way in which the Turkish police beat up peaceful female protester , this report come at exactly the right time .

in certain region a particularly rapid increase in various type of cancer have actually be observe .
be it true that a important a country a Germany have refuse to take part in the pilot project which have already be simplify ?
I also reject the absolutely perverse assertion of the & apos ; lack of credibility & apos ; of Europe , which be bind to lead to our & apos ; tactical inferiority & apos ; : whatever specific problem it might have , Europe be not Sudan , nor the People & apos ; s Republic of China , nor Cuba , Somalia or North Korea .
however , it should not concern itself with fiscal policy . that be and should remain a national matter .

there must be no delay , because we need to have these market function with a new legislation in place .

the financial Regulation or the response to Parliament & apos ; s demand that the legislative and budgetary procedure be update be two clear example of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation be still unsatisfactory .
for the national economy of the new Member States with relatively low level of economic development , the cohesion policy create the potential for gain ground on the developed state more rapidly .
rather than just table proposal , it need to make a studied demand for something in return . we need to know , for example , what the other developed country be go to do and which part of the system of protection for European Union farmer need to be safeguard .
