these rules have no place in a free trade agreement .
in contrast , the last paragraph runs contrary to the risk assessment philosophy as it imposes the application concurrently and simultaneously of all three basic principles , rendering the text unnecessarily stringent .
in effect , renationalisation will amount to restricting cohesion policy and we must oppose that .
how is it possible that this protocol was not submitted to the European Parliament until mid-October 2005 , 10 months after the commencement of the agreement and two weeks after the first payment was due ?
there is an obligation to include reference to the energy label in all advertisements of energy-related products , where price- or energy-related information is disclosed .
the third surprise is the fact that there is no one here from the Council , because this debate is on SABs .
it follows that there must be no lawless areas when it comes to combating terrorism , but what that also means is that we must now regard it as our common task to guarantee the security of our citizens wherever we can .
Mr President , the European Commission , which is headed by Mr Barroso , has , today , achieved greater support than in 2004 .
but the Brussels waiting rooms are large , and waiting times uncertain .
it is a logical contradiction which we need to cover with the terms imposed by decent work .
in this connection , I should like to say a few words about the security fence .
what we should be clear about is that it does not mean assimilation .
the directive , and particularly the solutions reached in the conciliation procedure are among the few items of EU decision-making which directly affect the everyday life of citizens .
in 2009 , I became the first ambassador of rape Crisis North East based in the town of Dundalk .
we believe that , at a time of great economic difficulty , the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market purely in order to make money is not very wise .
Ms McGuinness said that modulation was like robbing farmers .
we have not come that far yet .
the fact that some airlines have said that they are not yet in a position to switch over from pull to push does not depend on either the United States or Europe , but rather on the fact that some of them have so far been unable to change system on technical grounds .
from your long experience you will naturally know not to expect us to behave as dutiful choristers concerned solely with celebrating the advent of the German Presidency .
firstly , they are financially judicious , because , as has been partially explained in the course of this debate , they reflect an entirely satisfactory compromise on both the expenditure and the revenue side .
therefore , the Council has decided that before the Spring European Council of 2003 , fully 100 % of directives whose inclusion in legal codes takes two years must have been transposed .
lastly , the health of Roma women must be addressed , as they are the caretakers of the Roma community .
I want to state clearly here that Europe is a community of rights , where the mood of society reigns and decisions must be respected .
the Commission will be ready to continue discussions with Parliament related to the shape of future cohesion policy in the forthcoming months .
the agreement will enable these to be extended .
health problems aside , vegetation in forests , crops and vulnerable eco-systems are succumbing to steady poisoning , and our precious European cultural heritage - buildings and monuments which have stood for centuries - are being eaten away by aggressive chemicals in our air .
the funds obtained in this way can be used by innovative small and medium-sized enterprises which are engaged in the market-based recovery of secondary materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment .
admittedly , the debate on the location of sites has been opened , but this aspect cannot be considered unless there are major improvements in inspection and safety conditions .
I am not questioning the need for reform in the European wine market , but I believe we should look to other solutions .
follow the advice of your favourite singer : C &apos;est le temps du départ , retournez à d &apos;autres étoiles et laissez-nous la fin de l &apos;histoire .
another all too vague area is that of sharing data with third countries , as provided for by the proposal .
– Mr President , I should like to thank the Commission for the strategy for Africa that they presented on 12 October .
the rapporteur was concerned about the transparency of Eurofound &apos;s human resources management , and these concerns were echoed by the other members of the Committee on Budgets .
I would have liked the Commission to have had a firmer and more visionary approach , especially since we have all the instruments on the table today and this was the best option identified by the impact assessment .
rest assured that as far as the European Council is concerned , the ministers shall convey this message to the Heads of State or Government , and that we , as the Presidency , shall argue for the most stringent application possible .
this is because energy is , in fact , the greatest challenge and the greatest test .
we hope that this solution too will secure adequate safety conditions .
let us be clear that they are not necessary to combat Christian or Buddhist terrorism .
these were the words of Nehru to the constituent Assembly of the Indian Union on 14 August 1947 , a few hours before the proclamation of India &apos;s independence .
the debate is closed .
the fund provides aid to countries in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific .
in terms of social policy , everyone must pull together to avoid the distortions caused by social dumping - and I say everyone , to include in particular the country which has until now been opting out .
we have therefore voted in favour of the report .
they say that the human race has 10 years at most to bring emissions right down : or , as Chris Davies said , perhaps it is already too late .
in this respect , I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94 / 55 / EC which has been tabled for discussion today .
we recognise the importance of rural development , but we feel this cannot be achieved at the expense of the first pillar of the CAP .
only a fully functional Galileo and EGNOS system will be an asset to the EU , in all its policies , not least in transport , in agriculture , in the fight against climate change , in the prevention of natural and man-made disasters , and in the area of science , technology and innovation .
point 21 is particularly revealing in this respect and speaks of &quot; encouraging liberalisation of the Mediterranean partners &apos; economic systems and implementing the structural reforms required to enable them to compete on more open markets . &quot;
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , several urgent matters are scheduled for next Thursday .
I should like to point out that certain island regions already have a distinct , special treatment . these are the ultra-peripheral regions , which are already recognized , even in the new text of the Treaty of Amsterdam , in Article 299 ( 2 ) of the modified text .
my group has said , from the outset , that it is awaiting the conclusion of the investigation which is being carried out in the Italian Parliament on these issues , because we respect the Parliament of an important democracy which is a member of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is abundantly obvious that the elections and the referendum in Belarus were conducted in a manner that violated all the principles of the rule of law and of democracy .
it reminds me very much of the late Soviet Union , where every year they would talk about new record harvests and new maximisations and efficiency gains .
we are drafting a law here , and when we draft laws the entire House needs to give its opinion .
therefore we do not see the EU &apos;s Fisheries Agreements as a means of combating poverty and encouraging development which is sustainable in the long term .
I wish to propose an alternative plan , even though I have seen that a majority in this House has already been achieved !
in writing . - ( SV ) The original own-initiative report on combating female genital mutilation was very good , but the revised version , which won the vote , contained a wording in which the authors indicate the desire to introduce regular medical check-ups for women who have been granted asylum because of the threat of female genital mutilation .
this is hardly surprising , particularly when you realise that we have spent the last 18 months under Socialist presidencies .
therefore , I am very happy that we are having this debate and that we are competing with each other as regards who wants more - what more could one ask ?
we agree with the Latin American and Caribbean countries that our cooperation should be strengthened in all three areas mentioned .
we are very proud that we have been actively involved .
given the opposition by the Council to date , this is the best solution .
I am pleased to see our new Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio .
when we started Question Time we welcomed Mrs Ferrero-Waldner . that welcome has been repeated in a polite and friendly manner throughout the afternoon .
that will simplify fisheries management in the Baltic as a whole and make it more efficient , because the same set of rules will apply .
we must ensure that regional aspects are taken into account .
I would like to be assured that the Commission will consider very carefully the virtues of such an approach , because I suspect a proliferation of jurisdictions may , in the end , fragment our legal systems .
we have seen that in the recent past during the Moroccan Casablanca bombings , the tragic civil war in recent years in Algeria and the rise of Hamas , Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in the occupied Palestinian territories .
we must be open to new Member States .
we must also come up with long term initiatives to improve the socio-democratic situation and democracy in Karelia .
this is something that I consider to be important .
this is probably mostly wishful thinking .
this approach must also take account of the need to put more effort into the total eradication of diseases like leucosis , tuberculosis and brucellosis , and into adequate health procedures .
I really cannot oblige them to remain in the Chamber until now .
every single means must be used , first prevention , then recovery , and our politicians must be able to find a system in which these objectives do not pose a threat to one another .
I trust the anniversary of this event will be an occasion for Europe to examine its conscience .
many of my honourable colleagues accept the idea of a balance but consider that the power to strike such a balance rests exclusively with the local , regional and national public authorities .
Mr President , I would first of all like to join in warmly congratulating the Greek Presidency .
in addition , the developed countries must demonstrate that they are indeed meeting their financial commitments , particularly with regard to the fast-start financing .
thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection .
to the contrary , every error it identifies becomes one more pretext to justify the intensification and expedition of the process of total communitization , the supposed panacea to cure all ills .
. as our rapporteur ( and the draftsman of our opinion ) so eloquently expressed , ‘ preserving the cultural heritage as the common heritage of mankind is a central concern of our civil society , and the preservation and encouragement of cultural diversity helps to ensure peace , security , stability and development ’ .
we have to work responsibly and not be motivated purely by our self-interest as Europeans . it is true , however , that the Latin American crisis may destabilise the European economy if we fail to express our solidarity and to take prompt and decisive action to safeguard the future .
poverty is a very serious problem which affects 85 million of our fellow Europeans , and so no one should remain indifferent to it .
thus we are quietly informed that certain provisions were introduced into the instrument for monetary union simply to give an appealing impression at the time of the Maastricht ratification , but that now we must dispense with them to give the system its true meaning .
the limits within which European stock exchanges are fed from workers &apos; pension funds cannot but be much stricter than in the days when stock exchanges were simply casinos for the rich .
the framework in which further discussions may take place will then be clear .
that made sense , because President Trichet of the European Central Bank would have been present at the debate .
this report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display .
President-in-Office of the Council . - ( SL ) May I thank Mrs Harkin very much for her question .
I abstained in those cases where perfectly sensible demands were being made in terms of Parliament ’ s working conditions but where unnecessary references to the Constitution had been slipped in .
colleagues may be aware that this is a sensitive issue and in some languages and for some Member States this does give difficulties .
we have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it , as one would anticipate .
in the immediate future I will be coming forward with some important proposals in the social area , particularly on social protection and new methods of work organization ; and there will be , as I stated in my opening remarks , the proposal on information and consultation at national level .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , Mr President , then we can more or less forget being able to achieve reconstruction in the region in any real sense .
the only crime of many of these prisoners is to express publicly their opposition to the government as ordinary citizens , as independent journalists or as peaceful dissidents .
I think they are particularly unfair .
it is the Minutes that we are currently approving .
in its Green Paper of 21 May 2003 , the Commission calls for specific measures to be looked at once again to actively protect pluralism ; in its Recommendation of 28 January 2003 , the Council expressed the same concern ; in its Resolution of 20 November and the two reports by Mr Sylla and Mr Perry , Parliament said likewise .
( the President cut the speaker off )
( DA ) Mr President , Commissioner , in contrast to the previous speaker , I wish to say that if anyone believes that European jobs can be saved by placing duties on leather shoes from China and Vietnam , they should think again .
such issues are worth tackling in the short to medium term but , as regards the long term , EU Member States need to be more ambitious in their approach .
I went to Mellunmäki in Helsinki to talk about Eurobonds , and when I said what they were the women clutched their handbags tightly and the men wondered whether they still had their wallets on them .
the Commissioner will tell us whether this is an inadvertent error .
secondly , we need transparent and fair network access .
Georgia and Armenia could use the resources made available - which must be authorized by the Council and the European Parliament - not only to ease the burden of interest on the special financial aid , but also to pay off debts .
this in turn would mean that we should have to inject more structural funds , but these would no longer be available .
the outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the Commission .
when will the Presidency , therefore , propose a substantial increase in resources to verify compliance with current animal welfare legislation , and appropriate , strict penalties for breaking the rules ?
there are now over 3.5 million motor boats in the European Union and the number is rising .
rather , they are universally valid , as is enshrined in the relevant international conventions .
the declaration must now be followed up by real action as set out in specific instruments , realistic targets and effective timetables .
it is obvious that this initiative is worthy of full support .
unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .
I would like to make it clear that I have the greatest respect for you personally , but the institutions must have equal representation in such debates .
we have some tough and difficult climbs to get through at the moment .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would simply like to remind you that it was the polar bears on the ice floes who showed us how much chemical pollution was affecting the whole of the world .
I would also give no guarantee that the 15 Member States will put into effect the separating out of risk material , and above all that the heating regulations , which we believe to be right , will be observed .
so far , the Commission has not been able to eliminate this suspicion .
I sometimes wonder whether the Commission is speaking with a forked tongue , for it often emphasises the importance of good social goals of this kind , but at the same time these views are missing from this particular communication .
the report deals with work by the European Commission which takes account of this requirement for the first time .
in the long term , it would mean accepting cost increases on orders without being able to check if they could be obtained more cheaply elsewhere , which is why this trend must be reversed .
and I thought of the words of the lyrics of that song .
the next item is the debate on seven motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe , in particular the case of Farai Maguwu .
social protection consists of a set of hard-won social rights which progressively evolve .
yes , our citizens know that certain things need to change and that we cannot continue as before .
they called for assistance , support and help in relation to the drafting of the new constitution in Iraq , which is something I think we should do wholeheartedly and enthusiastically .
however , I consider that these amendments are outside the scope of the proposal discussed today , which is limited to extending the period during which the minimum standard rate applies .
as Members of this Parliament we must as far as possible promote relations between the European Union and Mercosur and determine how to strengthen any weak points so that in these relations we can ensure efficacy and success as far as possible .
however , these areas lead the world in developing the kind of logistics know-how for gathering this material , and growth in the industry is forecast .
unity is in desperately short supply , not only when it comes to the permanent crisis mechanism , but also when it comes to robust financial governance .
this evening , we will be talking to one of the Commissioners about socially responsible entrepreneurship . and that means that we will not only be talking about shareholders , but also about stakeholders , along with consumers , environmental organisations and employees .
in any case , the priority must be to define rules and procedures governing the treatment of victims which are as harmonised as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I intend to focus on one fundamental point in my comments on the budget lines for environmental , public health and consumer protection policy .
although we do not propose to take a debate on this matter , I hope the House will permit me to make a brief response on its behalf .
it is for that reason that what this House needs to do tomorrow is to set out a quite definite negotiating position , and to do so by as large a majority as possible .
the dissidents who have put up opposition have never once been honoured with the Sakharov Prize in five years .
we wish to bring fresh impetus to the negotiations through a trade and investment agreement .
for us Portuguese , who are geographically and culturally distant from the places of the main European horrors of the 20th century , and who have another history , it is even more important to remember them .
Mr Busuttil raised the issue of Libya .
I was therefore pleased that the revised Fuel Quality Directive did not include an earlier proposal to ban the fuel additive MMT .
it is also my conviction that the efforts of the European Parliament to promote coherence and more joint action are absolutely crucial .
the national interior ministers will have less and less control of Europol there will be no advantages in terms of the fight against crime .
I also support most of the amendments by the rapporteur , in particular the amendment which introduced the notion of proportionality , so that confiscation does not result in a loss of property disproportionate to the offence committed ; and the amendment which limits the scope of application of extended powers of confiscation to organised crime .
in Finland many different bodies share this concern , among others the Ministry of the Environment .
at the same time , it is evident that MEDIA is a highly successful programme , in that nine out of ten films shown outside their country of origin were supported by it .
we must , as I have already had the opportunity to , advocate the creation of a European rapid reaction capability .
one of the many indications we have is how Turkey is behaving towards the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople , and how it has behaved in this specific case towards the theological College of Halki .
the Euratom safeguards ensure , above all , that no nuclear materials - including plutonium - are omitted from the audit when installations are inspected .
I am just wondering that out loud .
admittedly it is not widely spoken , but this proposal is unacceptable .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I would also like to start by thanking Ms Ţicău and the other rapporteurs for the way that this directive has been negotiated .
author . - ( PL ) Mr President , there are serious breaches of human rights in Iran , in particular the threat to stone nearly ten women to death - I am speaking here of Iran , Khayrieh , Kobra N , Fatemeh , Ashraf Kalhori , Shamameh Ghorbani , Leyla Ghomi , Hajar and the sisters Zohreh and Azar Kabiriniat , and other people , too .
bringing Agenda 2000 to a successful conclusion is almost equivalent to squaring the circle .
we should apply this pragmatic approach in the future , too , so that we can strike a sound and , even more so , responsible balance between safety and economics .
I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty , by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty .
the question now is whether Europe can take any action which is politically relevant .
it is due to the actions of Europe that this agency has come into being .
furthermore , we still feel it is unacceptable that monies from a certain country ( and its taxpayers ) in which various actions are illegal could , as a result of the European mechanism , ultimately be used to finance these same actions when undertaken in another Member State .
as I said , this decision now lies with the Council and from my experience in the Agricultural Council , where I was present , it does not seem very likely that we shall have a positive reply .
there are two small points that I would still like to mention , the first being something strange that happened in July when I was doing a live radio interview from this building .
if a fingerprint register is to be established , we do not under any circumstances want asylum-seekers to be mixed together with either legal or illegal immigrants , and we want to propose that , under such a system , fingerprints are taken only from people who have been sentenced for having committed criminal acts .
it would seem more logical to us for diversity to be maintained , so that each country keeps the right to govern itself in accordance with the real needs of its citizens .
4. a declaration of a clear political commitment to the full emancipation of women .
I have not therefore changed my opinion on this .
I also welcome the visit to Moldova in January of the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe , Mr Terry Davis , and the launch of the OSCE &apos;s election observation mission .
hopefully , they will tell their new leaders that EU integration should be high on the agenda .
if Mr Seppänen will allow you to speak in place of him , then that is another issue , but he has the right to speak .
the Polish President said something remarkable this morning , which is true for both sides : &apos; one does not refurbish the house merely because there are guests coming &apos; .
this has been the topic , as we have heard , of a very heated debate and I feel that the rapporteur has given a strong sense of the feeling that voluntary donations are the preferred option in the EU .
that is the most important priority and the greatest challenge for the entire EU , and it is therefore also the most important issue for which the European Parliament and the other institutions have to prepare .
we are being asked to review the freedom of movement of people in Europe and to reinstate national borders in order to cope with the influx of migrants that has supposedly been overwhelming Europe since the revolution in Tunisia .
the tragic events that have befallen the country call for our solidarity with our partners .
firstly , I welcome the fact that following our first resolution in 2009 , the planned act entered into force in Lithuania in a less severe form and that we have not yet become aware of any instance of this law having been applied , and that its application in respect of the ban on the Christopher Street Day parade failed and the parade took place .
Madam President , can I compliment the Commissioner on her vision for the future of the industry , and may I say that I strongly support her intention to abolish milk quotas .
this is fear that women and children , in particular , should not have to put up with in the 21st century .
this is particularly valid with regard to the matter of prices .
they also aim to ensure an effective response in case of an accident by developing a harmonised framework for accident investigation , introducing rules on compensation for passengers in case of an accident and by introducing rules on shipowners &apos; liability coupled with a mandatory insurance scheme .
it seems to us that we are going down a dangerous path , and the European Commission should re-register its objection with the WTO .
we have seen it all before where certain countries are concerned .
finally , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that what we have here is a contradiction in se .
I therefore ask for a rectification , so that justice will be done to the decision taken by a majority here .
if you look at all the other satellite systems - the Chinese and Russian satellite systems and the American GPS - people are asking why we need Galileo .
I can assure the Chairman that the committee will be kept abreast of research and its assessment .
the Board will also advise the Commission on appropriate measures to facilitate implementation of the Code of Practice as it relates to Eurostat and to the European Statistical System as a whole .
I want to begin by placing emphasis on the question of employment policy , in particular to focus on traded public services - as distinct from the public service in general - and the way in which in employment policy terms they are critical to the creation of sustainable jobs in the Union .
the lesson of Yugoslavia is that peace on this continent is only possible if economic and social development can and does advance throughout Europe .
he has made a good contribution , and I would also like to thank him for finding a reasonable solution for the Committee of the Regions , which has been subject to very severe cutbacks by the Council .
there is an entire region which is of importance to us , and expansion to include a country such as India , for example , would be crucial .
rarely do they see prison overpopulation as dramatic , and its effects on bad sanitation , the prevalence of violence , the few attempts at social rehabilitation or the monitoring of young people , mothers , the mentally ill , alcoholics or drug abusers in prison .
this is another reason why , in my opinion , we in the EU must invest more in alternative energy suppliers .
there is no chance for the European Parliament to propose amendments to it through our normal procedures .
the crucial question will be whether Opel Europe can be profitable again in the medium term .
we have opted for training , and accordingly we intend to enable those Member States which prefer to set a younger minimum age to guarantee legal certainty in this respect for their citizens , but their systems would have to be graduated as prescribed in the draft directive .
perhaps it is even more attributable to a lack of willingness by science and industry to communicate clearly and systematically .
. – Mr President , the current situation of tension and chaos in Bolivia was , I fear , to be expected .
President-in-Office , thank you for your diplomacy .
question No 36 by Mr McMahon ( H-0221 / 97 )
wonderful !
Austria has achieved 40 % collection after 14 years .
finally , we must take advantage of the infrastructure around Hanover , which has been developed to a very high standard .
situations of this kind have severely eroded the confidence of the citizens and organisations concerned .
conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean
a remarkable state of affairs , given the sobering fact that hardly any foreigners live in East Germany .
for this reason , which in itself is positive , we are being presented with an extension of the directive that is totally unenforceable and unrealistic .
in our inclusion of the airlines it is especially important to keep the cost of the system down , for any airline today that does not operate an efficient fuel management regime pays for it with their own demise .
as regards the amendments , the Commission is able to accept 14 amendments as they stand . these are Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 23 and 24 .
secondly , it would appear that the Commission has not taken into account the damage that will be done to the viability of the postal service in Ireland because of the proposals for liberalization of cross-border mail .
( the President cut off the speaker )
in fact , the right of petition is essential not only for citizens but also for the Union &apos;s institutions , in that petitions enable the institutions to become aware of citizens &apos; real expectations .
the first oil crisis in 1973 was a political one , as was the second oil crisis in 1979 , but this is a lasting crisis , because all the indications are that reserves are by no means as large as we have been led to believe .
that , however , is not the point I want to make right now .
to that end , the subject has been placed on the agenda of the Council of Youth Ministers for its meeting on 9 November .
I welcome the adoption of the Casini report on the introduction of a transparency register common to both Parliament and the Commission .
as a bare minimum , it is necessary that workers are consulted before decisions affecting them are taken .
that does not mean that Ireland is not prepared to play its part , especially in peacekeeping roles .
for reasons of harmonisation and simplification , it is important that changes to marketing authorisations should be governed by the same regulatory requirements , whatever licensing procedure was initially used .
the threat to confiscate quota is an attempt to pressure farmers into poor arrangements and to sell against their will .
it is really rather hard to understand why a country on the Aegean Sea needs there to be an EU policy on the Arctic .
Madam President , first of all could I put on record my thanks to Mr Bowe who was the budget rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment for the first half of the mandate .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 12 February 1999 .
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities made huge efforts to combat violence immediately after Peking and as a result of these efforts the DAPHNE Programme was adopted , the extension of which until 2008 is the subject of today &apos;s debate .
they clearly demonstrate the contribution of the Commission &apos;s proposal to the good functioning of the internal gas market , as well as the importance of security of supply in a market of this nature .
the recent natural tragedy that occurred on Madeira has left the island in a state of chaos .
documents received : see Minutes
we mentioned the expropriation of church property , we mentioned the attacks on campaigners for human rights and blog writers - as brought up by Members previously in this House - and we also mentioned the situation of the adherents of Plum Village .
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996 .
apart from the problem of combustion of a methane-hydrogen mixture , something which I know about since my dissertation concerned combustion , it would be necessary for normal engines to also use urea to achieve clean combustion products in accordance with EURO 5 to 6 for the elimination of nitrogen oxides .
also , if we are serious about their value abroad , we must ensure more protection from third countries .
I think that there are many excellent points in these reports on how we can strengthen the European Union &apos;s overall impact around the world , in line with our values , in line with our interests .
it will be a difficult process , with many , many problems to resolve , but we must make sure that Turkey presses on with the reform process .
will he undertake with the SVC to examine the problem of long-range , unrecorded animal movements in which animals are largely treated as commodities , which has been the major factor in the spread of FMD ?
her murderers have still not been brought to justice .
we believe there needs to be a requirement for all aid projects to be informed by the dimension of equality and for women to be represented in the government .
I particularly welcome the Conference that is going to take place and indeed we can be very proud of the standard of our food products in Europe - I certainly agree with you on that .
that is the million-dollar question .
obviously , I agree with many of the things that have been said , but I would like to steer the debate some way further ahead to the future .
we can achieve this through improved presentation and transparency of the budget .
with the SWIFT Agreement and the Stockholm Programme , in particular , the &apos; transparent person &apos; is becoming ever more a reality .
this would-be panacea does not in fact work .
I believe that the Irish presidency does honestly want to make action for human rights a keynote of its presidency .
this requires a public prosecutor , and , as Parliament has already demanded on various occasions , one that is exclusively responsible for the Union &apos;s institutions .
in conclusion , I would say that I think the report which the rapporteur has produced is a good one , and we should join with the many others in thanking her once again .
a lot has been done , Commissioner , but there is still a lot left to do , and I hope that the control mechanism that you have agreed upon will allow some of the negative points that remain to be corrected .
it is a good example for any country intending to become part of the European Union .
however , I believe we must realise that , despite Parliament being sparsely populated , much of the general public across Europe is asking these questions following the election results in Italy .
I therefore fully agree with Mr Schwab , since the proposed Regulation aims to significantly simplify the type-approval legislation in the field of motor vehicle safety and tyres with one Council and Parliament Regulation .
radicalisation is on the march in Europe , and the political classes often seem to be in denial to some extent when it comes to these issues .
the directive we shall be adopting tomorrow is certainly a major innovation for our Europe , for the Europe that we all want .
in my judgment , India has shown a high degree of flexibility in recent times , and for this reason we expect the same from Pakistan as well , since there are close ties linking us to both countries .
Mr President , I have been a keen supporter of the alternative and out-of-court settlement of disputes for years .
our investment programme is lagging behind both the United States and Japan .
I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet .
its role is , on the one hand , to ensure the provision of professional retraining for the population involved in the coal industry and , on the other , to ensure a gradual transition to cleaner energy sources .
could I ask him actually to make contact with the Mayor of London and Transport for London to investigate why these buses have a 75 % worse accident rate than other buses , and to examine whether these directives are being properly applied in the UK , and specifically in London ?
can you please confirm whether the Commission will lead by example in this respect and , if so , when we can expect some concrete proposals from the Commission on this issue too ?
we think that the report contains both positive and negative points .
the European Council placed employment at the very core of its agenda .
7 .
these three ways of obtaining redress should prove to be quite adequate .
I therefore suggest that the sitting be suspended for less than 10 minutes , until nine o &apos; clock , which is the time the Minister is due to arrive at Parliament .
unfortunately , customs authorities do not have enough resources to carry out sufficient border controls .
all Member States concerned have made claims for an increase in guaranteed areas .
we also need the public sector and , indeed , the private sector , which I believe is the engine of growth in the economy , to work together in a spirit of partnership .
otherwise , in the final straight the politicians will be talking but the people will not be interested .
these proposals were approved by a large majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control , including that the paying agents in the Member States should be notified by Parliament itself and thereby become more professional .
I am particularly pleased because these are things that we also emphasize in the report , and they are evidence of a modern approach which considers the interests of patients and consumers as well as those of the industry itself .
to my disappointment , I now have to conclude that Parliament has not learnt anything from the lesson of the double ‘ no ’ .
President-in-Office of the Council , we wish to thank you for your most constructive , extensive report , and to wish you all the best for your Presidency !
I also wish to thank Mrs Hieronymi for having done such excellent work in the Committee on Culture and Education in the area of audiovisual issues .
regardless of this short temporary interruption , the Council has clearly stated that it is still committed to implementation of the mandate in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolution , particularly the humanitarian mandate .
just so .
Kigali - and this is official - has proposed organizing repatriation operations jointly with the FDL , through direct financing by donors , thereby relegating the international community and the HCR to the rank of mere observers .
in reply to Mrs Riera , I think that a great deal still needs to be done .
nevertheless , our view is that , in the current climate of relations , the prospects for progress are better now than under the Council ’ s previous policy , which led us up a blind alley , as did , to say the least , the policy which for decades insisted on sanctions and an embargo .
the proposal was then adopted by the Council of Ministers in July 1996 .
indeed , if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy , we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have .
this is a good description of the present Council proposal .
firstly , the proposals for the legal provisions will obviously need to bear in mind the international obligations .
if an interinstitutional dispute arises , I fear that we could find ourselves in a deadlock .
when we speak of racism , we generally think of refugees and immigrants , who are often the targets of racism .
Mr President , Mr van den Bos &apos; excellent report has puzzled me on two points .
( the President cut off the speaker )
it is essential that the supremacy of politics over street violence should be quickly re-asserted , the rule of law must be seen to prevail and to be effectively policed in an impartial manner .
I sincerely trust that the Florence Council will not degenerate into squabbles over mad cow disease , but that it will produce a sign of hope that social dialogue , the originality of your proposal , of your pact of confidence , will prevail over squabbles which threaten to damage public confidence in the European idea .
however , now is not the time to discuss how much progress has been made in resolving the problem of Kaliningrad or Ignalina or anything else .
where was the passion ?
Non-alignment with respect to NATO is the modern alternative for a mature state .
we ought to look at , for example , the case of remoter parts of the European Union .
when the EU &apos;s guarantees in respect of the European Investment Bank were renewed and extended to cover more countries than before , it was the European Parliament &apos;s view that the decisions should come under the codecision procedure and , furthermore , fall within the competence of the European Parliament , and not just that of the Council .
it is therefore urgent , ladies and gentlemen , that this initiative , which we have been discussing for several months , should become reality as soon as possible .
we wish , however , to place the emphasis on the legal framework for the elections , as well as freedom for the media and the conditions under which the campaigns of the different political parties must be carried out .
( the sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m. ) ( 2 )
that is where they are seeking security in the face of threats !
at the same time , you fail to address the European tendering rules that are throttling the small and medium-size companies .
this false promise that is being sold to parents costs money .
we are proposing the setting up of a policy advisory committee , as is the practice in country domain names , to assist in dealing with what can be registered at top level .
this means that we are already bound by international legislation for the protection of children against child labour , trafficking , violence and many other forms of interference in the lives of children .
for those who learnt nothing from the way in which the Turkish police beat up peaceful female protesters , this report comes at exactly the right time .
however , my view is that we are a long way from doing what is necessary ; there is an urgent need to review our policy on Bangladesh , not excluding the implementation of sanctions and certainly including the serving of stern warnings to neighbouring Pakistan and India to resist the temptation of interfering in the internal affairs of Bangladesh .
in certain regions a particularly rapid increase in various types of cancer has actually been observed .
is it true that as important a country as Germany has refused to take part in the pilot project which has already been simplified ?
I also reject the absolutely perverse assertion of the &apos; lack of credibility &apos; of Europe , which is bound to lead to our &apos; tactical inferiority &apos; : whatever specific problems it might have , Europe is not Sudan , nor the People &apos;s Republic of China , nor Cuba , Somalia or North Korea .
however , it should not concern itself with fiscal policy . that is and should remain a national matter .
during this same period , another 2 800 have been detained and I believe it is now time , Madam President , for this Parliament to deal with this very fundamental problem which should make us all ashamed and which requires this Parliament &apos; s action .
there must be no delays , because we need to have these markets functioning with a new legislation in place .
coming from Northern Ireland , where we alas have known much of that in our history , one ’ s heart goes out to the people affected by this morning ’ s terrible events .
ladies and gentlemen , we now proceed to the votes .
in exchange , Russia will want EU support in its quest to join WTO , where there are many unresolved problems , from its dual pricing over gas to export duties and discriminatory transport fees paid to Aeroflot to overfly Siberia .
the fishermen said this was rubbish .
at the moment , we have to wait for the various Member States to send in their lists .
in fact , it is no longer just a matter , as it was in 1995 , of restoring balance with Eastern Europe , but also of making ready for the future enlargement of the European Union .
the amendments to be put to the vote separately are therefore the following : 71 , 73 , 113 , 114 , 115 , 121 , 122 , 124 , 210 , 212 , 213 , 214 and 216 .
agreement between the EC and India on certain aspects of air services (
this is why I give my full backing to Mrs Schierhuber &apos; s report .
in this context , we should remember that a big tourist industry in Europe is founded on a high level of general prosperity and has very little to do with a common currency .
the financial Regulation or the response to Parliament &apos;s demand that the legislative and budgetary procedures be updated are two clear examples of the fact that interinstitutional cooperation is still unsatisfactory .
for the national economies of the new Member States with relatively low levels of economic development , the cohesion policy creates the potential for gaining ground on the developed states more rapidly .
rather than just tabling proposals , it needs to make a studied demand for something in return . we need to know , for example , what the other developed countries are going to do and which parts of the system of protection for European Union farmers need to be safeguarded .
in this context , too , let us also focus our attention on the reforms of the European Union , reforms which will be necessary to allow enlargement to come about .
Mrs Kuhn has done a remarkably good job in addressing this issue , with the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , to look at ways in which compromises can be found .
this is specifically true for relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission , because we know that the cause of greater and deeper European integration has been advanced only when there has been this spirit of cooperation among our institutions .
what is the alternative to the substantial commitment we have made ?
in today &apos;s proceedings , with our debate on the von Wogau report , we have an extremely sensitive topic to deal with .
Madam President , the media are already mobilising the populace for a third front in the war on terror .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca , for his conscientious approach and his efforts to reach agreement on an issue of such sensitivity for our citizens .
in view of the Court of Auditors &apos; statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable , and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular , I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2009 .
I have listened to you very attentively Commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in France and in Germany .
it is true that we are helping them by providing clean syringes and good user rooms , but the destruction continues .
this focus on objectives will enable the programme to deliver more European added value .
we witness the fight to preserve public services daily .
they do not accept euro-scepticism , the fear of Europe .
Gorbachev was right when he said : &apos; dangers await only those who do not react to life . &apos;
I do not think that any of us here can go too far in showing our concern about the handling and the transport of toxic waste , especially radioactive material .
the EU cannot deal with everything and the Commission is unable to fulfil the tasks allotted to it by the Member States , as the last Commission clearly demonstrated .
it has something to condemn , it has authorities .
I urge the Commission to accept these proposals .
the Committee on Fisheries and Parliament have always taken the view that we should stand together supporting the European Union in this dispute with Norway .
ladies and gentlemen , this whole discussion on limits is a matter for society .
the final point I want to make is that our real problem is the huge number of applicants .
the shipyard workers reminded us of this fact a week ago in Brussels .
firstly , with the euro , crises and disturbances in the economy are going to spread more rapidly on the capital markets , and Europe risks having an Asian situation .
in many cases the Member States have obligations which are not classed as debt , but which do , in fact , constitute debt in one form or another .
the next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast .
( DA ) Mr President , a lot of sensible things have been said during the debate this morning , but I think we need to look a bit more to the future .
and who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?
question Time ( Council )
the report says a great deal about the role that the European Union should play in all kinds of conflicts in the region , but nothing about the relationship with the United States .
if globalisation is to provide new opportunities , it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people , globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities .
in addition to this , the recent speculative attacks against certain Member States have made it difficult for the latter to borrow money on the international financial markets , thereby virtually affecting the stability of the whole euro area .
you can put all your comments about monitoring back in your briefcases , because these vehicles will of course be checked to ensure that they are of the appropriate type ; otherwise , they would never be approved .
the fact that access to retained data is restricted again means that it cannot be used for public surveillance .
we therefore believe to be timely , and we welcome , the proposal the Commission is making with this Regulation , which amends and updates those which have been in force up until now .
the European Commission must continue to help the Czech Government to minimise the social impact of adapting to the acquis communautaire , if possible .
it would also have been nice if Slovenia , Latvia and Lithuania could have been alongside them .
tolls are a hot issue .
our only aim is to tackle pollution at source , and to introduce measures to prevent pollution before it happens .
since the European arrest warrant has demonstrated the need to protect our citizens across the European Union , and we also have the tool to enforce this protection , then we must also have the courage to use it .
but the committee decisively overturned the copper amendments , which have been resubmitted to plenary .
Parliament wants to promote this through the SME guarantee facility and in so doing to create more jobs .
perhaps we should also consider a gradual increase in this form of cooperation , which , if its implementation is subject to rigorous quality control , could become a preferred form of cooperation and development aid .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
in many cases , WTO rules and case-law have been partially or completely disregarded , causing damage to Community industry .
right now is the time for us to make our contribution to the debate in the form of thoughts derived from the last four years , which have been an enlightening experience .
– Mr President , Commissioner , I would like first of all to offer my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur .
rather than react to the problems by introducing further centralisation , some of these contracting and selection procedures should revert to the countries themselves .
it is unfortunate that disturbing news from Pakistan has become all too common , nearly every day .
this is one of the ways in which some of the European States - Italy , for instance - continue , in actual fact , to manage large parts of the economy of the country and prevent there being in these sectors - the telecommunications and energy sectors , for instance - efficient , competitive companies and markets , companies able to withstand international competition .
can you not see the danger in this growing gulf ?
therefore , in 1993 the Commission adopted a recommendation on the tax treatment of residents &apos; income .
this is only a first phase agreement . it is the result of many years of bilateral negotiations , during which the United States was granted and renewed specific authorisations on wine-making practices , certification and labelling rules , completely &apos; for free &apos; .
unless the European Union promptly takes decisive steps , the resulting loss of credibility could have destabilising consequences for the region .
preventive action is always many times cheaper than dealing with disasters after they have happened .
there is no lack of creativity when it comes to the Middle East .
some Member States already have extremely good regulations , which could even be weakened by this Directive .
this has the depressing consequence that even at this stage , many deep-sea fish species are critically endangered , and that in many developing countries , the sea has also been emptied by Europe , or by European boats at any rate .
for that reason , we would ask you not to vote today but , by referring the matter back to committee , to give us an opportunity of putting some urgent questions to the Council - which may prove embarrassing - about how it came to embark on this procedure .
when we boast so much here about health and safety , how can we do something which undermines it ?
I am very grateful to the rapporteur for this important text , and I hope that the Commission and the Council will grant our requests in full .
no longer can we negotiate as we used to - in a very technical way , often with a very large number of questions going backwards and forwards , but now the setting of clear political priorities and the taking of political decisions really are the order of the day .
it was very good . if you also really mean what you just said , then you may yet become a hero of mine .
we must avoid a two-speed policy by means of which anyone who is financially secure can choose to travel to find the best care .
the four comitology reports , which the European Parliament is being asked to adopt today in plenary , aim to ensure transparent , fast and effective procedures .
we should also consider the global commitment to fight climate change .
what has been provided so far in terms of aid ?
first of all , we are engaged in a process - and here I should like to take up a concept which Michel Barnier used during the hearings - a process of developing a constitution .
let me give you a few facts regarding the latest strengths of our trade relations with China .
but there is a difference between taking action precisely to save the peace process or taking terrorist action to torpedo it .
Commissioner , I believe it is possible to produce a workable practical proposal that is supported by all stakeholders .
we want to convince people in Europe to switch to energy sources which nature renews afresh every day , which do not entail any environmental disruption or climate change , and which make a positive contribution to reducing CO2 emissions .
thank you very much , Madam President , and congratulations .
this phenomenon can be observed , for example , in the new Member States , where the scale of the challenges to be faced is enormous .
the debate is closed .
the Commission itself has undertaken to inform the complainant when we intend to leave a complaint without action .
and I want to say to you too that this date , this ceremony , is probably the most important ceremony in which I have had the honour of participating . the most important ceremony of my entire political career .
that effort , of course , took up 18 minutes , thank God !
these calls for tender will apply to all Member States and candidate countries , all developing countries and all developed countries , on condition that they are reciprocated by third countries and approved by the recipient countries .
finally , even though Mr Sarkozy has left , I want to thank him for his energy , his commitment to the EU and his efforts to find solutions to difficult problems .
textiles ( debate )
( NL ) I am very pleased to be allowed to speak using the catch-the-eye procedure .
these also include the directive on services and free trade , which our group has viewed critically .
I fully share the objectives of the Marco Polo programme , and the rapporteur &apos;s view on how to reduce road congestion and improve the environmental performance of the worldwide transport system .
finally , I would like to say that we actually intend to put forward a legislative proposal at the end of the year for how we can take a more focused approach with regard to the way we monitor and respond to disasters throughout Europe .
an anti-Mafia professional like Mr Fava should be able to understand it , it is not difficult , he too should understand it .
I believe that there are common elements in all of this .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Latvia &apos;s liberal law has allowed anyone to testify to their loyalty to the Latvian state and Western democratic values .
it should be stressed , moreover , that the vote of the European Parliament for the Fontaine report will not change in any way the very special situation in my country , which has to cope with different legal systems .
Parliament will certainly aim to do so but without dropping its fundamental requirements concerning a simplification of committee procedures and the need to ensure that implementing measures are monitored by the two branches of the legislature in a balanced and efficient manner .
I should like to thank her for her ready cooperation , and I also extend thanks to the Commission and the Austrian Presidency .
there are also parallel initiatives , however , that have been taken following Naples that deserve our agreement .
and , of course , our objective is to work with all the Member States and to exchange best practices so that some countries can imitate changes which are already under way .
I call on the Federal Government of Nigeria to ensure equal rights for all citizens , to fight the problems of control of fertile land , access to resources , unemployment , poverty , and to mitigate climate change .
yes , they are hard decisions , but these decisions will determine the future or the failure of the euro zone .
some very careful consideration will certainly be necessary , because the current authorities and the future European authority will have very different attributes , and so more thorough deliberation is probably needed .
the Cohesion Fund has been one of the clearest examples of this solidarity and action and what it can achieve .
because most forests are damaged by discharges which come from a long way away , responsibility for the air and climate is global and European .
this agreement would then form an annex to REACH .
however , it seems very difficult for the Commission to take on board these amendments in this proposal since the issues dealt with go beyond the scope of the Commission proposal which , of course , is limited in this proposal to updating the current text of the regulations .
on the question of principle , no Member of this House surely has so little respect for him or herself that they feel they should not be paid a proper salary at a level common to each and every one of us .
as I said before , the global economy is still extremely dynamic , and thanks to this there is still a trade surplus in the external sector of our economy , as demonstrated by the latest statistics published by Eurostat .
Mr Karas says that this is ein Schritt , it is just one step in the right direction and of course he is right , as I said in my opening remarks .
we therefore support the existence of relations between this Parliament and the Taiwanese Parliament by means of the delegation from our institution and also the need to open a European Union information office in Taiwan .
Article 17 basically asks the Commission to put forward proposals by the end of 2007 to restrict – not to ban immediately – the use of mercury in dental amalgams .
as with other matters , we are experiencing continuous and increasingly irritating delays from the Turkish side in relation to these issues .
I urge you not to trade NATO for such uncertain military aspirations cherished by a number of EU Member States .
finally , I am pleased that we have a section in the report on disabled peoples &apos; rights .
it fits the picture that that government was then voted out of office by the citizens at home .
Mr President , I must say that I cannot help being somewhat bemused by the suggestion from Mr Giansily about what Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing would like .
one issue which came up during the debate was that of how we are to deal with registers .
the groups involved are well organised , with networks covering many countries . they earn a great deal of money from their activities .
I have heard sophistry from various sides of the House questioning the legal basis which is to my mind just a diversionary tactic , questioning the tobacco subsidy in Greece , etc . it is quite clear that this is the moment of truth when we have to stand up and be counted .
our common objectives are , of course , to improve the competitiveness of our economy in the Baltic Sea area , taking particular account of the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises and of a common energy policy which also takes account of renewable energies .
this is the importance of this proposal for a regulation , which is intended to update and adapt rail transport statistics in order to be able to provide better monitoring and a more accurate analysis of developments in the sector , bearing in mind the measures that are to be adopted under the rail package .
we have constructed an impressive framework of high-level interactions where we regularly address the global challenges that our citizens are facing without neglecting the issues where our views may differ - and Tibet is definitely one of them .
indeed , it was not without reason that the ILO recommended the 48-hour week as far back as 1919 .
fourthly , paragraph 30 calls on Member States to work on the housing and transport sectors as areas where we can dramatically improve our energy efficiency and our conservation of energy .
it is my belief that this directive , along with the services directive , will bring us another step closer to the completion of the common market and to creating economic growth and new jobs throughout Europe , provided that the country of origin rules are observed .
this fee would help finance 90 % of the cost of these facilities .
like the speakers before me , I , too , think that the current framework for delimiting these areas is too rough and ready .
it is imperative that we understand that the European Union must play a leading role in setting its own goals , and also in pulling the Member States along on this road .
it does not matter what letters of the alphabet the terrorists use to camouflage their atrocities .
at the same time , it still remains to be decided how we are going to divide between Member States the number of flights that will now be negotiated with foreign partners , in cases when the number of flights is limited .
effective political control , proper communication , procedures and financial checks and balances were either not in place in Eurostat , failed to work , or were simply ignored .
this resolution , agreed by all political groups in this Parliament , expresses clearly our concerns , hopes and expectations .
nevertheless , we cannot have immigration at any price .
I thus agree with the rapporteur that the flow of information between Parliament , the Council and the Commission must be improved upon .
if the Eurocrats are so keen to give rights to European citizens , they should start by respecting their vote and by finally realising that &apos; No &apos; means &apos; No &apos; in French , Dutch , English , Gaelic and every other language .
free movement is thus guaranteed within a territory of almost 43 000 km of external maritime borders and more than 7 700 km of land borders , covering 25 countries and 400 million people .
I welcome the fact that rapporteur Bowis , who has done sterling work , has opted for a positive approach to the White Paper .
we should not forget this .
yesterday there were other important statements .
gas and oil from Iran to China and Russia , energy flows and resources in which European companies have for decades invested a huge amount of research capital – all this has been wasted for the sake of servility to non-EU interests .
only fishermen themselves and their fight can reverse these policies and prevent their extermination .
there are buses that are accessible .
our removal of health and social care services from the scope of the services directive was quite deliberate .
cooperation between the Member States in combating unfair online advertising practices should be stepped up , in order to avoid the consequences of internal market distortion and unfair commercial practices .
this conflicts with other provisions in the directive and with the Council decision on the conformity assessment procedure , which provides for the use of quality assurance systems as an alternative to such procedures .
the agreement permits , and makes provision for , such flexibility and our position on this continues to be what I have been stating in public for several weeks - all the agreement and nothing but the agreement .
enlargement is adding pressure precisely because it dictates agricultural price reduction to the extent that once the ten Eastern countries have arrived , EAGGF expenditure and guaranteed prices will not increase .
and indeed , what we have heard is impressive .
it is thus the job of governments and scientists to convince producers and consumers of the need for change .
as a result , the Arabs are also continually itching to get hold of nuclear weapons .
in short , it can become a symbol of Europe &apos;s ability to work together and innovate .
in order to contain this phenomenon , fine-cut tobacco must be able to act as a substitute for cigarettes .
as for the predominance of powerlessness , which arises from the absolute division and the complete heterogeneity of opinions were expressed here .
it would also be advisable for the Commission to take the directive on mother &apos;s milk substitutes up for review , as there are also problems here .
we are also collaborating in the promotion of democracy and the reinforcement of civil society .
it is obvious that Kosovo is lost for Serbia , not only because the Albanians , constituting the 90 % majority of the population , do not want to live there , but also because this is also supported by several superpowers , including the United States of America and Great Britain .
one of those mentioned - and which I support - is the challenge of proposing energy sources that offer an alternative to nuclear energy .
even more dangerous is the outbreak of violence presented as ethnic and religious in origin when it is clearly politically motivated , violence which threatens to destabilize the country permanently .
I can say right now , Mr Sacrédeus , that it is important to strengthen the principle of protection which you referred to in your question .
it is a phenomenon that cannot be controlled by one single measure , but demands a wide range of activities from the Member States and the EU as a whole .
Mr President , this Parliament has been a consistent critic of the Mugabe dictatorship in Zimbabwe , a country which , 20 years ago , was deemed to be a model for a prosperous , multi-racial African democracy .
gametes must not and cannot be compared to other tissues or blood .
the formation of your Commission is also a lesson in European democracy , and a lesson that citizens throughout the European Union are observing closely .
I was personally aware of the explanation , which you have now given publicly .
the case highlighted here this afternoon of the arrest of trades union leader Pakpahan and his state of health is yet another example which justifies our concern about human rights in Indonesia , and the condemnation of Mr Pakpahan and the fact that he was arrested as a member of the International Labour Organisation shows clearly the disrespect for trades union rights in Indonesia .
I hope the Commission , when preparing its green paper on the role of libraries in the information society , considers the views expressed in this report and takes them on board in order to promote a democratic information society for our citizens .
we must put a ceiling on the aid to larger cereal farms .
nevertheless , we must differentiate between the violent actions of small minorities who act like commandos and , with a nihilistic and violent attitude , seek to destroy the things for which we are working .
today , we are witnessing in Latin America a dangerous regression into socialist dictatorship and oppression .
the reason is that the problem is still growing and the European Union is not showing enough determination .
these are all positive signs which , I have no doubt , will be accompanied by a perfect balance between the reforms you are undertaking and the European values that every one of us here defends .
what is going on there at the moment is a great show staged by Mr Erdoğan .
education and training schemes must be constantly adapted and updated in line with market needs , which evolve and change in a continual and dynamic way .
now there are amendments tabled by you , Mr Stevenson , one of them jointly with Mrs McGuinness , which propose that the system be made voluntary .
in writing . - In favour .
as Neil Kinnock said here yesterday , this goes completely against a key principle of the directive , namely nondiscrimination .
as the author is not present , Question No 8 by Mrs McKenna lapses .
