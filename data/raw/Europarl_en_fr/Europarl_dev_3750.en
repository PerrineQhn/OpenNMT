(Applause from the centre and the left)
We know too that certain businesses continue to avail themselves of the possibility - something I rather regret about Mr van Dam's report - that we will limit this standard driver's certificate to the countries that are not members of the EU.
Finally, I conclude by paying tribute to the people who worked with me on this report: Stephen Hughes, chairman of the Social Affairs Committee, who is in Singapore representing us at the WTO, Sue Waddington from the committee and from the Committee on Women's Rights, Christine Oddy from the Legal Affairs Committee, the staff and secretariat of the Social Affairs Committee, and also the Commission.
However, technological progress and the demographic situation with regard to dejuvenation and the ageing of the population, mean that supplementary health insurance is not surplus to requirements and is even indispensable in some cases.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez-Cortines on her particularly important report, for, as she herself has stressed, before us is the first document dedicated by the European Parliament to universities as recognised institutions.
The recent conflict in Bolivia therefore reveals all the aspects characterising this situation.
This Parliament has no right to introduce legislation.
However, my group thinks that things can go further.
This does not imply that we have different objectives.
Such cooperation will become increasingly important in the future.
I am only too well aware that the very concept of the family has now been pensioned off, but it must be admitted that, in normal circumstances, the best thing for a child is to grow up in an atmosphere of love, with the care of a father and mother, in an environment of guaranteed stability and peace.
I am aware that this first generation of satellite communications still has to rely on the dominant military systems: both the American GPS and the Russian GLONASS. However, there is no doubt that this first step must act as a trampoline for the next stage, that is, GNSS2, which is planned for 2008.
For understandable reasons I have not gone into every amendment.
The Freedom Drivers are people with disabilities and high dependency needs, who want to enjoy the same freedom of movement that everyone else enjoys and that Europe represents.
in writing. - UKIP MEPs abstained because we do not believe that the European Union should be responsible for sending taxpayers' money to the victims of the Italian earthquake.
The amendments, however, that take over the substance of the proposal for a directive relating to Mr Kohlíček's report, civil liability and the financial guarantees of shipowners, can be endorsed without reservation, except for the two that refer to the establishment of a Community Office for the management of financial-guarantee certificates.
I am delighted to be one of the ten MEPs in the European Parliament group in the EU delegation.
(Applause)
What is stopping you from reacting, from acting, from rising to this challenge before it is too late?
Firstly: What is your opinion of President Clinton' s statement that Turkey should become a Member of the European Union?
The liberalisation of energy markets also means that the Commission will have to approach various forms of energy on an equal footing.
Mr President, the Johannesburg meeting - as has been said - is the third great summit aimed at creating an international strategy to combat poverty.
If this date is set later than, for example, 2007, it will, in my opinion, be completely meaningless.
UK Conservative MEPs are sympathetic to the thrust of the Bouwman Report but have voted against Amendment Nos 13 and 14, as well as some other amendments.
We need to do away with our narrow-mindedness when it comes to innovation and in policy.
The more we anchor our partnership in shared respect for our common values, the more strongly we can act to resonate those values in the wider world.
Up to now, quality wine has not been regulated in this way.
The Union needs uniform arrangements in terms of structures, definitions, procedures and monitoring.
This point must be emphasised in order to respond to those who say that it is immigration control that creates illegal immigrants.
Thus it advocates a moderate wage policy combined with respect for a 3% budget deficit limit and the "the implementation of structural reforms in sectors of the economy, particularly in the products and capital markets, including the pension sector, as well as in the transport, energy, communication and labour markets".
Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin - fur and leather - must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices.
Intervention, and of course pressure, at that level was unprecedented in our codecision history, and I have to say that at that moment the die was cast: REACH would fall short, far short of the aspirations set out in the White Paper, for example, back in 2001.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to clear up a misunderstanding that may exist amongst certain Members, and especially the general public.
Thank you very much, Mr Chichester.
Economic policies increasing unemployment, and insecurity, deepen citizens' crisis of confidence at the expense of Europe and its prospects.
Madam President, in the original resolutions the three sectors of most concern are mentioned: steel, shipbuilding and textiles.
These include, as well as immigration and border control and the revitalisation of agriculture, true equal pay for men and women.
I therefore believe that particular care should be taken to protect the debtor.
Although Mr Tavares is not with us, I want to thank him for the cooperation which we have enjoyed to date and to express on behalf of our political group our positive position on the resettlement programme.
There is less to object to in it.
Mr President, the first budget of this new financial framework confirms and reinforces the grave apprehensions we had during the debates on Agenda 2000 and on the interinstitutional agreement that goes with it.
– Madam President, following the transition to the Europe of the 25, the definition of border regions has surely also changed.
It is necessary that both the European Parliament and the Council be placed on an equal footing, whether regarding the right to be fully and immediately informed, or relating to the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of international agreements in fisheries and also to any negotiation of revisions to those agreements.
This dossier is of great importance for all electronic communications users in the European Union, and the compromise we agreed in the end with the Council - and they were not at all easy discussions - was a balanced one.
I appreciate there are still many concerns over human rights and democracy in Pakistan, but these are highlighted in the resolution.
We strongly recommend that the proposal be withdrawn.
The recent decisions of the Council are indications of this style of approach.
It is important to recognise the role played by local and regional authorities in promoting culture and to ensure that they are more involved in the implementation of the EU's cultural agenda.
The second legal problem is one of legal responsibility.
I have a feeling this would have a demoralising effect.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all the speakers have rightly emphasised the terrible situation in which the Congolese people, and especially Congolese women, are living in the east of that country.
It is one of the elements which have led, among other things, to the current impossibility of an accurate evaluation of the debt and loan balance of many financial institutions.
This is why, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree more with the text of the alternative resolution tabled by Mr Ribeiro Castro, which shall have my vote.
Mr President, we have been informed that a press conference, organised by Mr Vattimo, took place this morning to promote an Italian book which is clearly libellous: a book which has already been condemned in Italy, a book which libels a member of the Italian parliament.
Making them to do so by force would result in a war.
I therefore ask, ladies and gentlemen, that you give it the necessary attention today.
For instance, the reciprocity principle should be applied in the context of the legal remedies available in the event of commercial disputes, and there is a need to improve the protection of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents and geographical indications.
Clearly we await the results of your investigations but I suggest that, at the very least, it would be appropriate for you to issue some form of guidelines to Member States on their attitude to receiving applications from reputable and well-established gambling operators who simply want to be able to operate in other EU countries under the law of those countries, which they are perfectly entitled to do.
I therefore believe that I am speaking for the House when I say that by including these points in our agenda, we are demonstrating Parliament's political will to continue this struggle.
(DE) Mr President, I also voted for the Deprez report since, in my opinion, it is undoubtedly sensible at this time to use the planned troop deployment to strengthen the southern borders in order to bring the threat posed by hordes of refugees under control.
I would like to reply to some of the points raised.
I must inform those Members who do not yet know about the other requests for inclusion in the agenda that the ALDE and GUE Groups have tabled a joint request for the inclusion of a new item dealing with the case of the Iranian Mehdi Kazemi. I believe that is also a very urgent matter.
Mr President, we are beginning to establish a common asylum and immigration law in Europe.
I think Mr Schulz said it first, but it was repeated very often: we need to be very clear-headed about what we do and very determined on what we should do.
I am therefore recommending two amendments to the Parliament after considering the Audit Report and that of the Wise People.
That is impossible because we have an agreement with the Council and the Commission for the remainder of the agricultural budget, for all the necessary allocations, and that means supplementary budgets.
I believe that the Commission's original ambitions were on a grand scale, but that the final product is disappointing. I also believe that we should draw attention to the factors which are the cause of this disappointment.
In demanding that Israel fulfils its obligations, this House should note that Israeli workers continue to risk their own lives to supply electricity to Gaza despite the manipulation of that electricity supply by Hamas.
It is true that the recommendation does not specify what constitutes an acceptable level of charges, but the volume of charges currently being levied on the services in question is undeniably a cause for serious concern.
These tests can only detect the affected prion protein above a certain level.
I hope that, at last, a just solution to this 58-year dispute over Kashmir can be found, involving both Pakistan and India but, above all, the Kashmiri people who have suffered enough already.
I would also like it to be known that yesterday – as witnesses will confirm – Mr Hans-Peter Martin was behind this team, although he was not there today.
I do in fact have the feeling that little is being done about any of our recommendations, and I should like to draw your attention once again to Mrs Flesch's remark directed at Commissioner Liikanen.
What will be the attitude of the British Presidency in the continuation of relations between the EU and ASEAN?
I would also like to draw attention to the fact that European Union money should be used to improve the infrastructure of Member States, to educate people and such things.
On the other hand, it is also saying that it is ready to lay claim once again to this money from the Council if the money is required for buying property.
We know that public impoverishment is often linked to private enrichment of the few, and it seems to me that this is what is currently happening in the country: public impoverishment is plain to see, and so is private enrichment of the few.
Question No 9 by Pat Gallagher (H-0938/96)
Mr President, the Herman report is very much to the point and has the relevance we have come to expect from our intelligent and tireless colleague.
Mr President, the creation of a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has never been so important.
The euro has not been the problem.
We are talking about a humiliating and unjust phenomenon that - albeit to varying degrees - may be found in all countries and social strata, and that adversely affects women's living conditions, daily lives and participation in the labour market.
Tourism is also a means of diversifying the economy and of developing rural areas and regions with natural or demographic disadvantages, such as the outermost regions, remote or mountainous regions, and the most northerly, sparsely populated regions.
You have clearly demonstrated your ability to be progressive and creative, even on sensitive matters such as the sugar reform, in the pursuit of balanced reform solutions that properly prepare the European Union's agriculture to face up to its present and future challenges.
That is why we are also actively engaged - via our cooperation with our African partners - in looking collectively at this issue.
I would say that this is an offensive move on the part of the Council and also of their advisors, the , as they are called in Italian, since Coreper is the next level down from the Council, and it is in Coreper that the papers are prepared for the Council, as the Ministers are not usually experts in this field.
Following the modifications proposed by the Council, a modification to this amendment was suggested, stating that Europass national agencies fulfil this task 'where necessary'.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
That is why I am not concerned in the least by the 10% or the 25%.
Well, the code of practice can fulfil this need precisely and help bring about a genuine improvement in the pay principle.
However, the Member States must also assume more financial liability as regards implementing the Community budget.
Discussions were held for 18 months in the Convention and your participation was a determining factor.
The Commission wants to safeguard its independence and continue to use its expert groups.
The second issue concerns the draft for the simplification and modification of the coordination of social security entitlements of migrating employees. This issue has been on the table for years, and we know that the Belgian presidency intends to, and will try to, achieve a political breakthrough in this connection.
That was all I was able to convey, focusing on two issues to which the House has devoted a good deal of political energy and debate.
Mr President, every professional criminal organisation in Europe must have jumped for joy at the European Central Bank's recent decision to double its printing of 500-euro banknotes.
If they try to do so, they will be faced with the need to expand their infrastructure and with extra financial and administrative burdens.
Has any discussion been held about breaking the TACIS co-operation?
Madam President, yesterday the IND/DEM Group asked for all the votes to be roll-call votes.
First of all we have the recognised pathologies, those areas that are well documented and where further progress needs to be made, including the question of cancers linked to environmental causes.
We are not creating new Community legislation to impose sanctions.
This is the only way in which we will be able to build true sustainable development over the entire EU territory.
I know that it has already been assigned to others five times, but it is probably also an important debate to show that we are serious about the control but not because we now want high tax burdens.
The Deputy Minister of the environment met Carol Browner early this month and Martin Bursík, who is the Czech Minister for the Environment, is going to meet his partners in Washington - I think later this week or early next month - so there is already a dialogue.
More than half the population is forced to survive on two dollars a day, and a fifth live on one dollar a day.
It can help to maintain the diversity of our agriculture, and can do so in a competitive way, because farms that can sell their produce are competitive.
I therefore wish to congratulate the European Commission on its proposal which is related in a particular way to the problem which is referred to as 'burden sharing’.
We will do all we can to achieve that.
Yet the Commission tells us that SMEs, as I said, must be targeted and actively encouraged to get involved.
Brazil's role in helping to stabilise Paraguay, its refusal to recognise the new Honduran Government, its engagement with Cuba and Venezuela are all on the agenda.
I have a good opinion of the work of the assembly this year, including, in particular, the resolutions adopted on the effect of the global crisis on social conditions and concerning climate change.
Commissioner Mandelson, we note, has once again opted to travel to some important conference in another part of the world instead of discussing key issues for European industry policy with us in Parliament.
We are also in the process of updating the Union's action plan on drugs.
In the Baltic Sea strategy, the attractiveness and accessibility of the Baltic region is listed as one of the main objectives.
Here we commit ourselves to the rights of information and consultation of the European employees' councils.
The report contains aspects that we consider important, such as the belief that health is not a commodity and the concern it shows at 'the growing commoditisation of health care'.
I find what the Irish presidency of the Council said about the co-decision powers of the European Parliament particularly interesting.
'monitoring by the Heads of State and Heads of Government', 'the concrete commitments undertaken by the Heads of State and Heads of Government'.
This problem can be resolved, but the people in these countries should not be excluded just because you do not want to resolve the problem.
The rules implementing the 'citizens' initiative', approved today by the European Parliament, state that signatories need to come from at least seven Member States.
Commissioner Patten has made this very clear, as has Mrs van der Laan.
The EU position on LGTB rights is very clear.
Indeed, one of the things I welcome in this report is its recognition of the wide variety of reasons for people being trafficked.
I would not say that we have achieved major breakthroughs, but on a lot of issues, there has been progress.
In the original draft resolution of the European Parliament, only Poland was mentioned as an affected country, and it was only after I pointed out that the floods had also affected other states that its scope was extended to the entire region of Central Europe.
Errors should not be tolerated and the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, must draw up an appropriate report in line with the Treaty, to provide Parliament with a reasonable assurance that this objective has been attained and that action to combat fraud is being carried out properly.
However, some of my colleagues in this House are being less than sincere by pretending to oppose the directive because of the wording of certain ethical constraints in the proposal.
I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
Within the framework of combating terrorism, Central Asia has become the host area for new military bases and its militarisation is being dangerously reinforced.
(DE) Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, I am much obliged to the Commission for the initiatives and to Mrs Lynne for her most excellent report.
Are the new Member States sufficiently prepared, both politically and economically?
We sent the document to all rapporteurs – and to you – a few minutes after it was adopted by the Commission.
It is worth bearing in mind that the total data stored by European authorities amounts, not to hundreds of thousands, or even to millions, but to billions of units of data touching upon the personality of every individual, in that the information stored could, with ill intent – which I am not, however, ascribing to any state – be brought together to compile profiles in order to find out what those citizens we disapprove of are getting up to.
We have the World Cup next year: let us send a unified message from this House that we will not tolerate the beautiful game becoming ugly.
Mr President, I hope colleagues will indulge us for a few minutes if we eat into question time, but I hope we can hold at least part of this debate with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner present.
It is essential that all Member States criminalise all types of sexual abuse of children and that all European citizens who commit a sex crime against children in any country within or outside the European Union be subject to uniform extraterritorial criminal legislation applicable throughout the Union.
Mr President, my group has always defended the principles of respecting and protecting freedoms, human, social and national rights and rights to sovereignty and democratic development.
Ladies and gentlemen, my group is not entirely satisfied with the decision the Commission is presenting to us.
The applause from honourable Members is sufficient evidence that the proposals you have put forward and the commitment you have undertaken were greatly appreciated by this House.
The Treaty on European Union expressly lays down that the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice shall include progressively adopting measures establishing rules relating to the constituent elements of criminal acts and to penalties in the field of terrorism.
That may well be so.
This impact assessment must tell us whether this aid is sufficient to counterbalance the new international situation in the banana market.
Next, since not only is the allotted amount limited, since the ECU 390 million earmarked for that use have really been secured essentially by means of financial engineering, which boils down to taking funds away from a number of other appropriations, or from purposes to which they might have been allocated, particularly social objectives, to concentrate them on this new purpose.
This is a signal that Poland will discharge its obligations with regard to the Treaty.
In addition, MEDA can support specific measures under the Barcelona Declaration to help cope with illegal immigration.
Of course, the Commission has the prime responsibility for implementation and enforcement, and we would not wish to tread on its toes in that respect.
Mitteleuropa is here, everlasting in its geography and its history.
Together with Canada, we must work towards global equilibrium in a multipolar world, and I believe that a productive relationship with Canada in this process is something the significance of which cannot be overestimated.
Andrzej Wajda and other Polish directors are part of our European culture.
So I sincerely ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to give serious consideration to the rights of consumers, to the question of the proper protection of consumers and also bear in mind we are going to have a food and safety authority in operation hopefully next year.
Civil liberties have to be upheld.
For example, by combining PHARE with the INTERREG programme it is possible to prevent projects stopping at the border and thus being less effective.
This was essential.
You will abandon it!
They have grubbed up to such an extent that soon they will have to import wine in order to satisfy local consumption.
A reform approached in this way will be of no benefit to Czech, Moravian or, for that matter, European wine-growing.
That is unacceptable.
I also welcome today's repeated appeal by Commissioner Frattini to those countries of the European Union that have not yet opened up their labour markets to their fellow citizens from the new Member States to do so as soon as possible.
The licensing process was made much tighter at that time, and the Member States of the European Union went along with demands mainly from the United States to make the prevention of espionage more difficult.
We urgently need to adopt a single position and recognisable strategies.
We have taken note of it, and will look into it.
The way in which the organisations of the market have worked in the past has served rather than impeded the concentration process.
In other words, what I said was not yet exhaustive.
Honourable Members, I think that you can rely on us in this matter.
The major flaw in the current mechanism remains the question of liability and compensation.
What do we see now, though?
In addition to that, when examining the progress that Turkey has made towards the completion of negotiations on 35 acquis communautaire chapters since October 2005, one can see that only twelve chapters have been opened and, until now, just one - the chapter on science and research - has been closed.
However, these efforts must be significantly improved, given that Croatia continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU.
That is why we call expressly on the Commission, the presidency and on Mr Solana, whose absence today I find a little odd, to do their utmost to bring the Union into line.
This political dialogue will help enormously to resolve possible problems or misunderstandings and to support the procedure of rapprochement and cooperation, which will serve stability and the peaceful development and coexistence of the entire Mediterranean area.
I believe that it would be in the interests of decision-makers, who frequently also take decisions for others, to prove themselves more flexible in adapting the tools we have to modern needs.
It should be pointed out that the Treaty of Lisbon has made the ECB an EU institution.
A constitution for Europe.
At our last meeting of the interinstitutional group, we thought it was essential to start working this year on information actions, targeted initially at opinion formers and the appropriate intermediary information providers, on the role of the Union in the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union can endure and develop only when it is guided by historical truth and respect for human rights.
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 5 December 1996 pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
Secondly, there are the followers of the Dutch model, which tends more towards the treatment of drug addicts than control.
In this regard it is clear, of course, that these EU budget resources can, and must, only be allocated if there are signs of progress towards democracy in Serbia.
The ideology of liberalisation, deregulation and privatisation has led to the crisis.
First of all, on enlargement, we are talking here about enlargement of a very different scale and nature to anything that has happened before, and that has implications for the nature of the IGC which prepares for it.
Lastly, road infrastructure should be improved and adapted to current traffic levels.
I refer to Iran, Russia and China.
I hope that other EU States will react in the same way, including my homeland Sweden.
in writing. - (PT) We voted against the final text because, among other issues, it assumed a position of defence of economic and financial groups, as highlighted by the rapporteur who removed her name from the report before the final vote and called for it to be rejected.
The recipe is simple: quality wine, and promotion.
Mr President, I would like to ask those colleagues who oppose the Treaty to explain precisely what is they mean when they speak about a 'self-amending' treaty.
We were ready for true solidarity, where the rich - as indeed we are - offer a helping hand to give and to support rather than to take and to trample.
The first essential to try to resolve the situation is to have proper political and economic stability within the country.
It puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes
Our position relates to the report and not to the outcome of the Convention in its entirety.
We can, overall, concur with the findings and recommendations of the report, which are fully in line with the views of the Commission on how best to use financial assistance for the Western Balkans and for Turkey.
Because let us never forget that our Union is founded on values: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Let us commit ourselves to ensuring that, in the further course of events, the challenges of globalization and the organization of our planet into large regional groupings capable of guaranteeing growth and full employment will show us the right course to set for Europe.
One is a decision to ratify this Convention on behalf of the European Community; the other the regulation required in order to implement the Convention in the Community.
The Commission feels that its own proposal offers a balanced solution which can effectively guarantee freedom to provide services as well as safeguarding Community seafarers' jobs on passenger services between the Member States of southern Europe, which is a highly labour-intensive sector.
Allow the creators and others in the United Kingdom to have a fair debate about whether we should have a blank tape levy.
Might consideration be given, Commissioner, to assessing whether China is actually implementing WTO trade rules and complying with fair and equitable commercial practices, unlike the way in which it is patently violating WTO law?
(The oral amendment was accepted)
In this context, I would also like to mention that an ordinance was issued recently in Romania on implementing measures supporting the uniform enforcement of EU legislation, which harmonises the conditions for marketing products.
Before accession, we called on all Member States who wanted to come into the European Union to abide by European Union rules.
In the meantime the Commission will continue not only its active role in the negotiations but also its work on Community measures.
The number of errors occurring is too great for a guarantee of this kind to be given.
I know we will have a debate on Japan in a few moments, but I hope that, in the days to come, as well, the Council will accommodate any requests from Japan for specialist assistance.
If only all those who do not have a good word to say about globalisation could recognise, for example, how strong Europe has already become in the sphere of foreign direct investments, as is evident from this report, or indeed in all kinds of other areas.
The next item is the report (A4-0027/99) by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on reinforcing cohesion and competitiveness through research, technological development and innovation (COM(98)0275 - C4-0491/98).
In particular, we need to give consumers an important tool, class action, on the basis of Article 153 of the Treaty, which would be useful in discouraging fraudulent behaviour in any quarter.
I can only congratulate all of us - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - on going through the conciliation procedure and thus concluding our work on this far-sighted proposal.
In that situation, there have been attempts at negotiation, and there have been mistakes.
At the same time, however, I am concerned, because we need to be aware of the fact that Israel has nuclear weapons, even though the country denies this.
The baby-boom generation is beginning to retire in this decade and by 2050 the number of those in receipt of a pension in relation to those of working age will have doubled.
This is why the Members of the European Parliament wanted to see a much firmer commitment to organic farming, much firmer than information campaigns which, useful though they may be, seem to us to be an inadequate response to the issues at stake.
We were promised a euro-cum-mark that would be stronger than the dollar, and which would compensate for the weakness of economic growth by means of the on-going revaluation of assets.
I do not have anything against intermodality, but that is not the aim this time round; this time it is first and foremost about modal shift.
Under these conditions, approaching culture in terms of the industry, the market and added value, as if we were talking about cars or oranges, is very dangerous.
It goes without saying that Member States will adopt measures specific to their national context, but they must not run contrary to the internal market and EMU.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
First and foremost, the development of treatment possibilities for patients requires that the field of application of the regulation be extended as far as possible, in particular to new indications even for well-known pharmaceutical products and forms of treatment.
We wish to warmly congratulate you on your decision.
This was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1967.
We most definitely do not need a European supervisory authority to take responsibility for content or services.
Some are technical changes, for example, specifying the ships to which the regulation does not apply, warships in particular.
Especially because - in my opinion - we are working on and talking about an issue of great importance to the citizens, which should in principle be of interest to them and which I believe does interest them.
I believe the European Social Fund needs specific and simple rules.
When it comes to historical waste, the Member States are required to compile an inventory whereby they have to investigate where there may be historic waste causing environmental problems.
Mr President, the completion of the internal market in electricity and natural gas is a wonderful opportunity for further development in the European Union in terms of the economy, the environment and also society.
If we want to work in the interests of our citizens and to ensure sustainable development, then we cannot banish all industrial production from the Union, give the wind and the rain our best regards, block nuclear power and endlessly push up energy prices through useless bureaucratic measures.
Restricting investment would be one way in which the European Union could exercise influence in its own right.
In conditions such as that, which will become ever more frequent as a result of global warming, the local resources were stretched to the limit, despite the fact that, in previous years, the weather was milder and Corsica had been spared.
The Intergovernmental Conference mandate must therefore be broad in scope and include an investigation into the basic principles of the Union's decision-making process.
We need to stand very firm on this.
As I said at the beginning of this speech, VAT touches the lives of every European citizen.
I am of course informed of remarks and public statements by our colleagues on the practice of Members with regard to the payment of expenses and allowances.
In other words, although the decisions of this summit will, in theory, concern the Member States alone, in practice they will concern the new countries too.
Parliament should rather have noted, with satisfaction, of course, the determination of the Heads of State and Government to reach an integral agreement on the taxation package as a whole (taxation of savings income, business taxation, interest and royalties) at the end of 2002 at the latest.
Alongside this, we also need to discuss adjustment of the budgetary interinstitutional agreement (IIA).
Then, because it used ambiguous, even contradictory, language on the subject of the status of the Sudanese people.
This fundamental choice involves, at the same time, not giving the hard-liners in the Islamic Republic any excuse to undermine this promising path of reform.
We must link the Integrated Guidelines with a social dimension.
These two proposals are being made under the 'third pillar' and will need to be revisited when the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force.
Mr President, the Act of Accession is associated with regulations on certain nuclear power units, and at EU level special attention has also been paid to safety in the means of energy production.
I agree with the principles of this report. I disagree with the estimated effects of all these amendments, but I think that is consistent with my position at all times.
The Commission shall consider whether the proposed rule on the advance payment of 10 % will lead to difficulties in view of the short duration of the project, and whether the proposal needs therefore to be amended.
This proposal, which is partial and modest, is concerned with measuring CO2 emissions from new cars.
Reports of sexual misconduct by members of the UN peacekeeping mission must be looked into in greater depth and those responsible must be brought before a court.
A third series of amendments that I have tabled concerns the availability of language courses and accessibility to them in the respective Member States.
I would like to suggest that there is a total lack of logic with the VAT rate on newspapers, books and magazines varying from zero to 25 %. We also have a situation where new education and information resources often attract the full rate.
Well, in the Czech Republic, the Beneš Decrees have currently been left in force so that Václav Klaus will sign the Treaty of Lisbon.
These concerns are profoundly misplaced. They stem from worries about illegal immigration from mainland China, not from the special administrative regions of Hong Kong or Macao.
This a very ambitious project, but I would nevertheless like to point out that if we in the European Union establish new institutions it might be very important that, before we do so, we ensure that existing institutions can obtain adequate funding.
Further south-west, in France, my parents spent many days in the dim light of the petroleum lamp which I had given to them once as a present.
This is the directive's greatest added value.
The debate is closed.
The emphasis on maintaining the EU's territorial integrity and an economic security clause designed to secure the EU's communications and supplies implies a defence capability for the European Union.
What we should actually be asking ourselves is whether or not we have gone into recession.
I would say the same thing to our important ally, the United States of America.
I believe, like the Commissioner who proposed it, that we should first do some thorough work to see how the Posting of Workers Directive is implemented in practice, and assess the possibilities for safeguarding against social dumping within the framework of the applicable legislation.
Mr Cashman and I have worked together on openness a great deal in recent years.
You can also look that up easily in the legislation.
The requirement for equality between men and women conflicts with the idea of freedom.

On a number of specific aspects that have been raised by speakers, I would like to make the following comments.

The situation can only be defused by the use of diplomacy, but the EU must not let itself be taken advantage of by the US in this respect.

What is quite intolerable is the continued sabotage of the proposed Fund by certain governments.
I hope that this type of problem, which is a result of over-implementation rather than under-implementation, will also be addressed in the report that is provided for in Article 16(4) of the Services Directive and that is required to have been produced before the end of the year.

Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way.
I want to speak from the perspective of the rapporteur on internal market strategy for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
That is why I have my doubts about the rapporteur's proposal that, to take account of changed family structures, there should be independent schemes for men and women.
(DE) I did not vote in favour of the Brok Report, because at least one of its paragraphs does not make adequately clear mention of the Council's blatant breach of the law.

We wish to express our expectation and, I would say, our hope, that today' s debate and the conclusions of next Friday' s European Council will be a decisive step forwards in the long and difficult fight against international terrorism.

If some of this does manage to trickle through, there will always be some Finance Ministry or other which, by sketching worst-case scenarios, combined with strong exaggerations and their own interpretation of the figures, is prepared once again to awaken latent fears, put enlargement in a bad light and even to use the candidate countries as bargaining counters in the political wrangle with other Member States about the review of agricultural policy.

Closure of the sitting
I know that the United Kingdom is a strangely insular place, and it is true that even its Government is too frightened to face up to nationalists and xenophobes and has insisted on asserting self-defeating opt-outs from key areas of European unity, sometimes pushing Britain to the margins.
In Lisbon, we will find the fruit of our preparations, on which we have worked together, with the cooperation, for which I am extremely grateful, of the Portuguese Presidency. We will find specific, operational undertakings, clear objectives and a limited number of tangible, but assessable measures which will enable us to speed up change and make progress, because leadership in the next century is being decided now.

rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, this is the first time that Parliament has debated a report on the economic situation in the euro zone and I therefore regard this report as being of unique importance, particularly as this debate - this analysis that we are conducting jointly for the first time - is taking place at a time when the situation is both politically complex and economically uncertain.

On the classification of third countries, the Commission proposal adopts the same conditions for imports from certain third countries whose rabies status is equivalent to that of the Member States as those which apply for internal movements.

Unfortunately, however, there is no separate vote on a compromise amendment.
Increasing the number of participants could prove to be a positive development by providing the conference with fresh momentum.

Nevertheless, our anti-war position does not mean siding with that regime, which must account for its crimes before international courts, and it does not mean being indifferent to the dangerous path being opened up by the violation of international law and the many other violations, such as the use of prohibited weapons, the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people, the treatment of prisoners and the fate of the Kurdish people.
Finally, will you please indicate, especially in the White Paper, whether or not you will now agree to prepare a legal act via the codecision procedure.
I profoundly regret this and I would appeal to my colleagues' sense of responsibility.

What the Council has arrived at this time could perhaps be improved next year, because we are always becoming better or more skilful at administering these rules.
This will be the task in the coming period, even if you bear in mind that work in this field is likely to change permanently with the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.
I also consider that we not only can and must act together to solve Europe's problems, but also that the European Union is well placed to be part of the global solution.

Alongside that, we must ensure that the authorities in the individual States provide information within an appropriate period of time when asked to do so by the Committee on Petitions.
So, I would like you to assure us this evening that you are making a serious effort to move more quickly in this area; and also, given the benefits of new technology moving forward in this area, with many more business-to-business transactions being handled electronically, more business-to-government transactions being handled electronically, that you are planning to exploit that technology in such a way that statistics can in future be collected automatically. Both more reliably and automatically and also, as Mr Beysen says, "internationally as well".
Mr Michel, in respect of whom it is generally known that he regards the European code of conduct for weapons export as no more than a scrap of paper;
I would also have preferred that the paragraph added by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had requested the same from Cuba as is requested from other countries with which the European Union cooperates.
It has brought nothing but trouble. Removing internal borders does not guarantee freedom of movement for European citizens; rather, it creates insecurity and produces unmanageable population and migration trends within the EU, both in the countries of origin and of destination.
A second convention was drawn up stipulating that the consent of the prisoner was not required, but this convention was not signed by all the Member States of the Council of Europe, and thus the attempt foundered.

We have the advantage of a fixed term, we ought to use that for future financial perspective periods.
b) Greek legislation no longer limits these favourable arrangements to religious objection; they now extend to conscientious objection in general.
We must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40% in non-returnable funds; we must aim not just at EUR 600 million per year but at achieving between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion per year for the next ten years.
The second question is: If the ferry companies' income is to be reduced by approximately 30 per cent, which probably will be the case if duty-free trade is abolished, how will this affect transport charges?
It is not because it is in the collective interest that the approach must be global.
I do not think we have done that yet.
Iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned, but this House, at any rate, will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights, and I would also like to remind the Commission and the Council that any agreement has to be approved by this House.
This resolution reiterates, in a balanced way, not only the requirements in terms of security but also the guarantees that the data of European citizens will be protected and that their fundamental rights will be respected.
However, less emphasis has been placed on the whirlwind in which our currency would have found itself without the European Union's economic and monetary policy.

It is my opinion, therefore, that we do not have much time for debate, especially not on whether we should automatically reject certain cures that seem unusual or new for the very reason of their being unusual or new.
We have never had such a clear overview of the intentions, strategies and points of view of the business sector as we have today when we create the framework programme, and, of course, in the final phase, the specific work programmes.

I do not really like my fellow Members saying that this is a problem for the poor countries of the European Union.
The Austrian Presidency has enabled us to make progress with an agreement on the European driving licence, for which I should like to express my gratitude once again.
It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States, but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names, although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time.
We are all presented with a common challenge on how best to manage migration flows and integration policies.
(CS) The report from Mr Onyszkiewicz is undoubtedly one of the most important documents to appear at the close of our electoral mandate.

The Committee on Development adopted this own-initiative report (drafted by Glenys Kinnock (PES, UK) on a special place of children in EU external action in response to the Commission communication on the subject.

How would you react if we had not come here with results that, despite everything, reflect a consensus, and what message would we be sending to our public?
It was for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs, saving only one vote to the contrary, took the view that the proposal should be put to the House in its present form.

As we approach the 10th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child it is time we put an end to the press-ganging of children to be used in fighting wars.
The objective of the Committee on Agriculture and of the High Level Group is to examine competitive practices and the transparency of the internal market in the food sector.
There is, in fact, a strong link between this report and that on environmentally hazardous waste which we discussed recently.
However, the utilisation rate for the demersals is much worse. In this regard it is only about 23% utilisation.
I therefore invite you, and the Council, to give it serious consideration.
Finally, as regards mergers and acquisitions, which generally create problems and huge job losses, we have already been in written and verbal contact with Mr Monti, the Commissioner responsible, and the Directorate-General responsible, so that the Commission can monitor application of the legislation for the Workers' Committee to the maximum and can check if all the provisions of the law have been complied with before mergers take place and major decisions are taken.
Thank you, Mr Rübig.
However, we need to monitor the power of the supermarkets and to look at whether they are passing on the price increases they are charging to the producers of food.

Our policy towards future members of the European Union should be a very important part of the latter.
We therefore welcome the proposal which limits the maximum permitted alcohol level in the blood to 0.5 mg alcohol per ml of blood.

(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation, who have helped to keep the process alive.
Mr President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on his report. This report is about the future - which makes a change from the debates we were having earlier - and, in particular, about relations between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament with a view to greater democratisation of our institutions.
The central fact of this conflict is that Georgia did not invade Russian territory, whereas Russia invaded Georgian territory with massive military force and was about to occupy its capital.

First point: joint enterprises.

I thank the shadow rapporteurs who also worked on this report and the colleagues who helped bring about a good result in committee.
If we do not include a specific article in the Treaty, we might consider a clear mention of Article 128 on culture.

We are hoping for a positive reply and a positive response from the Turkish side.
In accordance with the order in which they have requested the floor, Mr Ortuondo and Mr Dhaene are before everybody else.
The economic view is still much too dominant and so in my opinion the strategy is too one-sided.
As for myself, I believe that it would be very complicated to work out a country-specific conditions system.

The only way of finding this out is, however, by contacting the Belgian authorities.

To close, I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, on his important and consistent work.
The main cause of the poverty, the hunger, the lack of security and the socio-economic problems plaguing the continent - and which are rightly listed in this report - is in fact the very bad and corrupt regimes which make no effort at all to observe good governance, democracy and human rights.
There is a great temptation to cut back on training, maintenance or staff, and safety is threatened.

Mr President, European finances do cause great concern to my constituents and to people in Britain.
It is indeed schizophrenic for us to call for subsidies and then decide not to enter the few pennies required in the budget!
Clarification, because we Members of Parliament soon realised that the contributions made by Commissioner Solbes and the representative of the Council did not make it clear why the legal basis has been changed in Article 63(4).
Today, such embarrassing practices are a central theme at the World Summit in Johannesburg, and the European Union should therefore use that forum to call for fair trade, the abolition of unfair subsidies and the opening up of our rich markets.
(Applause)
We also need to take into account the problems of the dairy farmers in Austria and the Alpine region.
Even the EU Commission had to admit that it could not meet the comprehensive requirements for the energy refurbishment of its building stock.
There are the new minefields.
We have just one or two people to support us.

Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area.

But we find that matters relating to environmental policy, public order, security, fighting crime, quality of government administration, the rule of law, are all open to consideration for a joint approach - in short, virtually the whole spectrum of topics also discussed on the admission of the candidate countries.
The next item is the report (A4-0098/97) by Mr Pradier, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on illegal and harmful content on the Internet (COM(96)0487 - C4-592-96).
I therefore ask the Commission once again to provide a better definition of the concept of cross-border area and region.
We shall also insist upon clear answers on the subject of openness.
It is about production and employment in the textile and clothing sector in various European Member States.
As we know, Mr Brok's report stresses that the Union's interest should focus on its neighbouring regions.
The same applies to cotton where, although the minimum price is EUR 101 per 100 kilos, Greek producers will be paid less than EUR 65 because of the co-responsibility levy.
We can of course try to avert our gaze, but the situation will become ever more pressing.
When we vote on it, as we will do tomorrow, we will be bound by the rule that a majority is required to reject or amend it.
E-health was also dealt with in a very sensible fashion in that it is offered in order to provide flexibility, and Member States can pick it up if they wish and when they wish.
On this point, I think that the Wortmann-Kool report could have been more stringent.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Downgrading the press is not on our agenda.
Women must be encouraged to plan their career, but this cannot be done without an efficient childcare system.
Having had in-depth discussions with the various Council Presidencies – starting with the Danes, then with the Greeks, and now with the Italians – we now have the opportunity of wrapping up this issue once and for all.
The fact is that the international TV companies are on the scene much more quickly than those of us from the European Union and those from various aid organisations.

Israel does not want to make this distinction, but the European Union does.
This technique is not science fiction.
This list is to be seen as no more than a list of substances that have to be examined; it neither categorises them nor pre-assesses them, nor does it claim to be exhaustive.
Access is to be guaranteed for people with reduced mobility.
I wish to point out that this is not the only example of attempts at imposing recognition, on a practical level, of the Turkish military occupation of part of Cyprus, the so-called ‘Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus’, which is not recognised by the United Nations.
In the case of Albania, there is still a long way to go, as this report makes clear.
In my opinion, the Council's position on this is unacceptable.
I do not hide the fact that we had expected to make more rapid, more intensive progress as regards joining Europe, and in particular perhaps to encounter higher levels of understanding.
However, some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process.

Should there be a supreme being, should Zeus still be around, he should be able to fall in love with Europa once again.
What we are asking for for other island regions, although they are not so far away from continental Europe, are measures similar to those provided for the outermost regions.
What mechanisms for monitoring the effect on jobs has the Commission put into place, and what support will the Commission be making available to those people and industries affected by the BSE crisis?

Let one thing be clear, however: the financial markets are closely watching the Member States in terms of how they are dealing with their budgets in a declining economy.
Every minute, a woman dies for reasons connected with childbirth.
I am sure that this weekend's European Council, which is the same European Council that met on 11 February, will strengthen and preserve that stability.
The compromise proposal, as adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, creates, in my view, another problem.
It is obvious, however, that to get an agreement is one thing - and it is our duty here - but to see its practical implementation and then to benefit from new rules will be yet another challenge.
Neither in your words nor in your declared ambition for Europe will they find this impetus today.
Our report also refers to the sexist use of pictures of women in the media, and particularly in the digital media, and we are therefore calling on the Commission to promote the drafting of a gender equality code for the media, which will help to promote gender equality in the media, both in terms of the information they convey and in the media organisations themselves.
Fighting against poverty means improving cooperation between the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the ILO and the WTO in order to integrate macro-economic stability and development policies with social policies.

Mr President, despite our wet Irish climate, major flooding was a relatively uncommon occurrence in the past.
I also feel bound to point out that we should not lose sight of the fact that Tacis is, to a large extent, a trompe l'oeil window: however much we improve the window catches, they are merely 'painted on' , and the window will still not open.
The United States and the European Union share great responsibility for international economic and monetary stability.
You said that the path that the US is taking is historically the wrong path.
(EL) Madam President, the fact that broad agreement between the political party has prevailed in today's debate confirms that the European Parliament can act as the guarantor of European democratic civilisation and for the protection of human rights, human dignity and the right to life.
We need to make sure that people who come to European universities or scientific institutes to study or train do not remain here for whatever reasons, whether working or not, as this represents a loss for their own countries.
Europe can help by encouraging and funding programmes for lifelong learning, language skills and cultural exchange, to mention a few examples.
The revision of the timeshare directive excludes the registration of unreliable service providers and thereby increases the chances that people will not fall victim to fraud as is all too often the case today.
The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible.
Numerous and often drastic instances of violations of the rights of people who, solely because of their Christian faith, are treated as second-class citizens are evidence of the violation of the fundamental principle of human freedom: the freedom to practise a faith.
If it cannot be channelled directly to producer organisations, then the budget that is left over, in the light of major frost damage in large parts of Europe and other natural disasters, including drought, can still be spent in the sector in order to ensure that it survives these difficult times.
The report that has been presented to you today is a document that is both vast and ambitious, because it attempts to provide an overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States and because it calls on the national authorities and the European institutions to adopt practical measures.
Particularly in a globalised world, a great deal of importance should be attached to the competitiveness of the regions.
This is the reason why, despite the most disappointing budgetary allocation, the Union for Europe Group will support the report by Mrs Fontaine, whom I commend here for her work and her determination to see the European Voluntary Service dossier through to completion.
We have noted that point.
We consequently had no particular incentive to press ahead with recycling, as some countries did.
This issue has not, as far as I am concerned, followed the proper democratic procedures.
For example, in the information and communications sector, whose share of GDP is 40%, we are dawdling along cheerfully behind our competitors.
Amendments Nos 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 56 and 61 are needed to make the new directive applicable to hazardous waste as well.

A scattered national regulatory framework is not adequate.
.
I truly hope that we vote in favour of this technical package because, by doing so, we will be able to reach an agreement at first reading and to fulfil patients' expectations quicker.
I complete agree with those who say that we need to continue and consolidate the process and the strategy defined in Luxembourg.
As part of our ongoing work, it goes without saying that we are also examining the cost involved in introducing a new system and in adapting existing systems and - even more importantly - how each could help consumers, manufacturers, dealers and public authorities by providing better value for money.
This is nonsense, not least because the chemical industry in Europe is not controlled by large companies.
It should also have criticised the efforts of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to block a more progressive view of the fight for women's rights.
. Following the tsunami disasters, the Commission proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the future Generalised System of Preferences for all the countries affected by the tsunami, particularly Sri Lanka for textiles and Thailand, Indonesia and India.
On the hypothesis that Europe will develop steadily towards variable geometry, nothing, then, prevents the involvement of Turkey in certain European policies in fields where there is a real commonality of interests.
The international community needs to make an effort to do something.
This has particularly been the case since last year’s enlargement.
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations will clearly support this report.
In principle, three objections have been raised to this.
There is a reason for this which is that dozens of Spaniards were among the many people murdered during the Pinochet regime; it is estimated that over 3 000 people were murdered during that black period in the history of the delightful country of Chile.
That is why it makes good sense to talk about local action plans and about the exchange of experiences and information from this work.
In Poland, for example, we have a paradoxical situation.
In addition, it has been noted that the national measures adopted in the Communication's wording differ very greatly, both in terms of application and control.
Families are a very disparate entity across the Union and therefore to try to adopt common social policies, legal policies and economic policies which deal with all families is probably a mistake.

The Medina report and its follow-up have shown that the European Parliament can take an appropriate initiative by itself in this matter.
. We regret the fact that our proposal in support of increasing the global financial envelope for fisheries was rejected.
I must however be insistent on this point, because such a Community instrument, which would operate as a zero sum game in the long term and require practically no financing whatsoever, would at the very least warrant investigation, not - I repeat - as a means for opposing the laws of the free market to which we are subjected but as a way to control the suddenness with which they are imposed on us and to reduce the impact that increased oil prices have all along the price chain in the sectors concerned.
One step in the right direction has, however, been taken and is worth mentioning.
For example, the number of open enquiries addressed to the Commission decreased by 20% in 2006 in relation to 2005 and 2004, and we more frequently acknowledge our mistakes and apologise.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here in this room spend far more time than we would like on planes and at airports.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Lewis, except when it comes to the foreign budget, agreeing on the 2006 budget really ought, of course, to be a simple matter, for there is plenty of room for the increases requested by the Commission within the ceiling of the financial perspectives.
Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched.
Consequently, one of the most important recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry was the replacement of this whole archaic system, based on paper and stamps, with a computerised system.
I should perhaps have liked to have seen the rapporteur insert just one simple clause to the effect that we must bear this concern in mind, for if we in actual fact listen to the legitimate concern the Member States may have and, at the same time, opt for the maximum solution, I think we shall succeed in combining the broad vision with the facts.
'Without delay' changes the meaning of what we are attempting.
Moreover, the regulation provides that all special procedures will disappear and that all implementing measures including those on trade - various measures such as anti-dumping or countervailing measures - will be subject to the regulation.

It is a tax on trade rather than on profits.
The debate is closed.
Today, we must make families more stable and help the men and women who are in dire need of reassurance and support, as their lives are often in danger, even when they live in exile.
This to my mind would be the wrong way; it would reduce the effectiveness of what we do and lead to a waste of scant resources, or to the duplication of instruments.
First of all, can we apply our prices policy?
The judgment by the German constitutional court, precisely because of its authority and its strength, should have led, and should still lead, to a comprehensive legal and political debate in this House that specifically deals with the dangers, the risks that may arise as a result of the European Union federalisation process introduced by this treaty.
Iceland, and the nations now stuck in your raspberry Reich, will be free at last.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, at this very late hour, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Arsenis, for his commitment and his work in preparing the report on forest protection and information.

It is quite clear that if nuclear power and access to nuclear energy are handled in an irresponsible way, this will seriously damage both Europe' s opportunities for growth and its ability to deal successfully with what is, in my view, the most serious threat to the environment, namely climate changes due to increasing carbon dioxide emissions.
Consequently, the European Union shares responsibility for supporting the peaceful resolution of conflict and building confidence.
We are living in extraordinary times which require extraordinary measures.
Although all the toys that appear on the market from 20 July 2011 onwards will have to comply with the new Toy Safety Directive, and although we in Europe have the world's strictest legislation as regards toy safety, constant care is necessary.

The decision taken by the European Parliament finally gives us implementing rules too, which means that we have an instrument with which we can encourage mobility in the European Union without loss of social security.
These are ambitions we could very well have arguments and discussions about, and it is an area in which we could take the Union forwards.
President Milosevic has a clear choice.
We need the European public to have greater involvement and to actively exercise their citizenship.
Action must be taken on the legal front, upstream, before fraud occurs, as well as after the event, downstream, with a view to identifying a means of severely punishing those who flout the rules of what is known as "good practice' .
Firstly, the present proposal for a directive deletes the reference to guide levels.
The Austrian Presidency wants to continue offering this willingness to engage in discussion on behalf of the Council and wishes to maintain dialogue with your House.
We must therefore stand by our offer of a 30% reduction in CO2 by 2020.
Statements by the President
As Mrs Langenhagen' s report stresses, we believe - and this is one of its special features compared to the GPS system - that GALILEO must supply a public signal, that is, a robust and precise signal which cannot be interrupted as a result of military issues, as happens in the case of GPS, and sensitive applications, whether they be public - customs, judicial investigation and so on - or private - such as banking transmissions.
This gives rise to the impression that one of the unfounded obstacles to the opening of these negotiations are mutual bones of contention, including relations with Greece.
Ever since human beings have tilled the soil, they have been practising genetic engineering without knowing it.
Our main criticism centres on the fact that the Commission, in its overall analysis, is trying to treat environmental, safety and health aspects in the aeronautical sector as a separate debate, by means of a separate communication, when, in reality, the impact of these factors on the future of the industry is crucial.
Mr President, Mr van den Broek, we welcome the fact that the Commission is showing a certain flexibility and is, after all, following this Parliament's idea of a starting-line.
To mention just one example: some of you suggest that we have another target than the two-degree target.
Security - when we are all being monitored by the SIS register, which knows everything, even down to whether we have any sexual peculiarities?
As far as political support, adjustment and preparation are concerned, however, I do hope that the essential last-minute adjustments will indeed be effected.
Madam President, UK pesticides were tightly controlled in 1985.
I do not therefore want to be accused of that type of thing again.
Several subjects have been touched upon.
There is one person I would like to mention, whom I refer to in our group as the Friday godfather, the one who always has something to say, and that is Mr von Habsburg.
It is true that the Council has had great difficulty in reaching an agreement, as a result of the Member States' very different points of view.
The main concerns regard the management of procurement procedures and criteria used for recruiting staff.
(FR) Mr President, I intend to speak specifically about the Mediterranean region which, as the rapporteurs have reminded us - and I thank them for doing so - is very important to Europe in foreign-policy terms.
The first point is that analyses show that people do in fact want to have children, but parents - not just women - do not have children because the framework conditions are not right, because they do not have any social security, because - as has already been said - it is more difficult for parents to find employment and because career and family cannot be combined.
(DE) Mr President, the most hateful and violent regimes ever known were the anti-religious regimes of the Jacobins, Nazis and Communists in Europe.
At the same time, we must also create the conditions to ensure that developing countries can participate alongside us in this global effort.
Mr President, in that case, I ask for this report to be referred back to committee.
Mr President, as the whole world has affirmed, the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army is a totally irresponsible provocation.
There is still a lot of concern about it, and I ask you to bear that in mind.
You are right, Mr Hallam. One can only give an explanation of vote if one has actually taken part in the vote.
I supported the rapporteur's proposals and the approach adopted in the Commission communication 'Towards a Single Market Act', as well as the idea that an annual Single Market Forum is required.
Many forms of violence against women need to be combated: people trafficking, physical and psychological abuse, practices such as clitoral circumcision or the feminisation of poverty, and many others.
The tariffs are already in place and the ACP countries are urgently looking for the financial support the EU promised during the negotiations.

The Commission will play the role attributed to it by the Treaty in the course of the codecision procedure while facilitating the approximation of the positions of both parties and, in the end, ensuring consensus.
The ALDE Group has called for the entire safety culture and the human factor to be included in the test.
For others, including me, this is far from being quite so obvious and, above all, quite so automatic.
Is it ensured, for example, that the training of the staff, the certifications and the working conditions are properly monitored?
Honourable Members have also raised concerns about health and safety and the environment.
What this means, specifically, is that the EU will be able to continue to support its farmers and to guarantee a reasonable - and only a reasonable - level of Community preference for farm produce.
I would like to reiterate the words of Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, who said: 'We are on the side of freedom'.
But there are few signs that we are even beginning to make a start in doing that.
They should be given better support, including financial compensation from the confiscated proceeds of crime.
Finally, let me say something about the topic which also features at the top of the Swedish Presidency's agenda, namely climate change, because we only have a few weeks to go to the Copenhagen conference.
Furthermore, before the end of this year, the Commission will present a communication on the internal security strategy and that will contain concrete proposals and threat assessments for the coming five years.
This was an experiment which I think worked well but there is no doubt that it can be improved further.
Mr President, the shortage of bras in our department stores has indeed proved to be a beneficial crisis because it has exposed the EU for exactly what it is: a backward-looking customs union, an anachronism in the 21st century, and a bloated bureaucracy that failed to spot the obvious happening, while the Commissioner was enjoying a lengthy holiday.
It is also vital, in my opinion, that the Bank be encouraged to follow the example of other leading central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in America, and make transparency a central feature of all its activities.
The report also legitimately insists on the need for further harmonisation and uniformity in the implementation of the customs legislation, and for further improving the organisation and working methods of our customs administrations.
I thank you for this and for your constant support for the general objectives and the general principles of the Commission proposal.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by thanking you sincerely for your remarks, which bring me neatly to my first point, namely the European private-company statute.
This is about industrial growth and development. It is about protecting workers' jobs, because we know the importance of trade and export to doing precisely that.
But it takes two to tango, and the oil industry dropped out of the dance after a while, Commissioner.
Mr President, there have been very frequent debates in this House about the demands made on us by energy issues; we have debated the time it takes for resources to burn out, the natural demand for them – which is limited – and also the additional demand that arises from large countries with expanding industries.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am in favour of abandoning the use of cages for laying hens.
I believe the fragmentation of legal rules acts as a deterrent both to companies and consumers from buying or selling across borders.
This was a natural thing to do as President and I knew that I was repeating the views of the House by stating this, and I certainly made this very clear in my first statement.
We discussed these problems yesterday when preparing our resolution, and I believe that the motion before the House is an acceptable compromise.
That is why we demand, before the revision, a report on the current state of ratification, implementation of the conventions, an impact assessment of the effects of the GSP during the period 20062009, the inclusion of a condition stipulating that 27 fundamental UN conventions must be implemented, and more transparent investigation processes - involving, in particular, regular consultation of Parliament.
Quite the reverse in fact: the concept of universal services is ideally suited to solve problems encountered in rural areas and areas which are difficult to access, via agreements and, if need be, compensatory funding.
With respect to the particular case of Rocco Barnabei, the Commission is able to provide the following clarification, as obtained from official United States sources.
Certainly it is fair to say that generally, Member States and this Parliament too often skate around the important issue of employment.

The fact is that he should not have been in France and the Council must now take vigorous and effective steps to close the loopholes and galvanise international moves against President Mugabe before the tragedy of Zimbabwe is again overshadowed by other international crises.
Secondly, the decision-making procedure has changed - the Council now makes decisions by qualified majority, while Parliament has gained the right of codecision.
Like our colleagues in the USA, we want to be able to follow how decisions are taken and also how weightings occur in the discussions.
The report is based on the general assumption that there are a large number of chemicals that pose a threat to both human health and the environment, and ignores the positive health and environmental benefits to society arising form many man-made chemicals.
It is an opportunity for European leadership which I am sure Parliament will want to seize, as do the Commission and Council.
Mr Cox's proposals present a somewhat contradictory situation.
Moreover, if there is a real desire to achieve transparency, a say must be given to those able to act as a counterbalance.
In the vote on the budget, we have in general voted against the committee's proposals to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1.
I believe that our attention should be focused on ensuring that the European Union and America speak with one voice and take joint action on issues relating to the promotion of democracy and human rights.
Why should they suffer while the EU system's budget expenditure is completely unaffected by reality?
We shall also present a roadmap for gender equality which will look at different European Union policies and see how they can contribute to reducing gender gaps in employment or unemployment conditions and to addressing the phenomenon of violence against women and trafficking.
How can we allocate the accessing central and eastern European countries a full place in a European Union with EMU.
Computers have been confiscated with a complete disregard for legal guidelines and without any expert record made of the data currently stored, allowing the authorities to falsify evidence and settle scores again with political opponents.
The European Parliament is a co-legislator here and we need to make sure that we do our work carefully.
The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort, in order for them to effectively be the Union's interface with the world.
Wednesday' s vote is an important opportunity to signal to the new Commission that business as usual cannot be the guiding principle in Brussels.
What remains of the directive is a pastiche, the outcome of the rationale that compromise should be taken to the extreme, lumping together views that cannot coexist, namely unbridled liberalisation and protection for the corporate privileges of certain categories and sectors.
Such a process would also cover procedures and practices for issuing visas.
In the systems in continental Europe custody is nominee registered, and the investor has no direct contact with the issuer.
It is my hope that, with these three amendments adopted and voted upon tomorrow, the Danes can take this forward as an 'A' point on 20 December and they will be adopted very quickly.
The debate is closed.
At his own initiative, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, established a group of Commissioners that is to develop the European Union’s policy agenda in these areas.
Commissioner, please listen to the voices of Members who are often elected at a local level and who know full well that if there is not a "Mr Reconstruction' on the ground, who is responsible to the Council, the Commission and Parliament, many of the problems we have encountered over the last two years will be perpetuated.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Berès' report concerns the procedures relating to membership of the Economic and Financial Committee, on which the Economic and Financial Affairs Council must make a decision.

MFA is granted at a time when the EU is also participating in the mobilisation of finances to reform Ukraine's energy sector.
But what are we going to ask Yasser Arafat?

Ironically, and just for the record, I should mention Article J2, the third paragraph of Title 5 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states: "Member States shall ensure that their national policies conform on the common positions" .
What the Commissioner said was extremely important and we fully support your comments on the right of interference and the need to stop and think, and on complete respect for the humanitarian effort, which should possibly result in consideration of sanctions at EU level.
From this point of view, it is essential to ensure true policy coherence between policies directly affecting the LDCs, such as development aid, trade, fisheries, the environment, agriculture, climate change, energy, investment and finance, in order to reduce poverty and guarantee decent incomes and livelihoods for the inhabitants of the LDCs.
We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised.
This is the source of the conflict between the beer-drinkers of Northern Europe and the wine-drinkers elsewhere in Europe, and I fear this must affect the balance in the Council of Ministers.
We have wept and wailed on each other' s shoulders for the last three years. Either we have confidence in ourselves or we do not even attempt such measures, for what we lack is not money but confidence.
So she is a little behind the times.
I hope that this second-reading agreement will have real results and will encourage the free movement of construction products, improve standards across the EU, and promote the recycling of construction products in future whilst, most importantly, not increasing bureaucratic burdens on businesses or confusing consumers.
The Commission remains nonetheless committed to a regionalisation approach in which exports can be allowed to resume in safe conditions.
I myself thought that its biggest weakness was that it mixed two product clusters - different in terms of their nature and therefore their risks - in the same directive.
Secondly, it is not correct that we considered public order to be the highest priority, because if we had really wanted to give priority to public order we would have disarmed and disbanded the secret police.
Even the number of people dying from a simple cold is much larger that that!
This report clearly addresses the priority areas, the acute problems and those that are more deeply rooted.
I think that if the burden were spread over the Union as a whole it would not be too severe, and this is what we need to do to tackle the root of the problem.
I agree with the assessment of the Green Paper and with the analysis of the concept of territorial cohesion, and I endorse the recommendations for the future of territorial cohesion that are contained in these reports, particularly the following: definition of territorial cohesion; publication of a White Paper on territorial cohesion; reinforcement of the European Territorial Cooperation Objective; integration of territorial cohesion in the future development of all Community policies; elaboration of additional qualitative indicators; measurement of the territorial impact of Community policies and proposal of ways to create synergies between territorial and sectoral policies; development of a comprehensive strategy for regions with specific geographical features, particularly the outermost regions; establishment of a more comprehensive system of gradual transitional assistance to the so-called transition regions; and development of multi-level (European, national, regional and local) territorial governance.
Finally, concerning Mr Sylla's main point, the high media profile of this disaster should not distract our attention from the scale of the humanitarian crisis caused by five years' conflict in Congo, already ECHO's biggest customer - EUR 32 million in 2002.
We asked for controlled and gradual liberalisation.
I believe that Cancún and its results can be viewed, along the lines of what my colleague, Mr Seeber, was saying, from the perspective of Copenhagen: Cancún viewed from the Copenhagen perspective.

We are on the side of the millions of Nigerians who believe in democratic elections in the hope that democracy is the key to resolving political, economic and social problems.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt does stress in her explanation that it does not involve a reversal of the burden of proof, but we feel that the phrases which aim to facilitate the protection of consumers and injured people are too vague in legal terms.
Significant results have been achieved in a number of areas such as the environment, telecommunications, education, pension reform and research, but progress has not been as good in other areas, with Commission proposals stalled and the deadlines set by the European Council itself in jeopardy.
I do not believe that one can, on the one hand, request greater transparency from the banks by criticising them for the non-transparency of the financial markets, which led to the current crisis, and, on the other, seek to abolish the tools of transparency that are crucial to economic operators themselves and to the economic regulatory policies that we want to conduct at European level.
Clearly it is in Scotland's long-term interests to protect the marine environment and to conserve its wealth of marine resources for the long term.

The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 10 April 2008.
It is absolutely essential that the measures we discussed on money laundering and related issues are harmonized and that we bring Europe's laws up to date.
In addition, the circumstances have become much more difficult, the economic climate is unfavourable, uncertainties have increased and, as the President of the Commission rightly says, entrepreneurship is extraordinarily difficult at this time.
Is that not unbelievably farcical!
And I must tell you that, so far, Mr Wolfowitz’s response indicates that he is committed to continuing to work on these positive aspects.
We will keep you informed of the conclusions of this examination.
This might soon force the European Central Bank to raise interest rates and jeopardise what is already only weak growth in the eurozone.
Now, the Commissioner has just told us that these measures are included in the rural and regional development programmes which he mentioned.
. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the hour in which a dream becomes reality, a moment of such magnitude that I have to admit that I am overwhelmed by it and can scarcely keep a grip on my emotions.
In its conclusions, the General Affairs and External Relations Council at its October meeting last year agreed that the Russian proposal to open discussions on the conditions for the eventual establishment of a visa-free regime would be considered as a long-term issue and that further discussions should take place within the structures of the partnership and cooperation agreement.
Without giving ground on the concept of human rights, which the European Parliament upholds, it would have been possible - and, I think, far more useful - to deal with this matter in such a way as to contribute to a positive evolution in China in this field, rather than make demands of it which are not even always respected by the European Union's Member States or allies.
I therefore welcome uniform regulations that may make it easier for people to move without difficulty between the various Member States of the EU.
Mr President, I do not think there can be any need for me to say how strongly I respect the feelings and views expressed in this debate by so many Members from all sides of the House.

We also propose that the top two or three researchers in the countries from the two most recent waves of enlargement should go on a tour of the top five universities and research centres in Europe.
One of the hardest things for me to understand is this: if Parliament decides at the beginning of this year to set up a parliamentary committee of inquiry because customs services in the countries of the European Union are not working properly, despite the fact that these customs services have years of experience with all manner of regulations, if things are still not working properly why is it necessary to extend the system?
Unfortunately, it is very often the case that overnight events lead to us here in Parliament spouting out waves of political demands that I sometimes find somewhat dubious.

It is an important issue for the financing and therefore the development of SEPA cards and withdrawals.
By correcting the unbalanced distribution of the burden we create the conditions for a viable budget for the future.
It is a cornerstone of the internal market which offers young people, in particular, scope for the future and by means of which, something which I also consider to be important, particularly women are still given the chance, even if they have started a family, to cash in on their professional training on the market by finding a good job.
In the light of the Joint Strategy adopted in 2007, which proposed the introduction of a more bilateral approach putting the EU and Africa on a more equal footing, I agree on the importance of such a strategy.

From my own personal experience, the reverse is in fact true.
OLAF is a Commission department, but it conducts its investigations in total independence.
That is something in which we have a role to play in the JPA, and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation and elsewhere, because, unless governments make this a priority, I am afraid we are whistling in the wind.

Madam President-in-Office, I would be most interested in hearing your views on this.
A fourth aspect that was very important to us in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was to future-proof this Directive.

The debate is closed.
This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds).

In the name of urgency, but also in a state of total confusion, the Council and Commission are trying to make us swallow texts on terrorism that are always questionable and often have not even been put to the vote.
We have special need of such decisiveness at this time when, as the previous debate highlighted, we are feeling the economic and social fallout from the crisis provoked by 11 September more and more acutely in Europe; at the same time, the Member States need to move into action by instigating public dialogue and integrating the fight against social exclusion into all their policies.
We must never forget, however, that from the environmental point of view and also for geopolitical reasons, the final objective must be to replace current fuels with non-contaminating and non-conflicting sources of energy.
In North Africa 10 factories are currently being built to produce floating glass for the European market.
The first is the improvement of energy efficiency and demand management, particularly in the building and industry sectors (SAVE). The second is the promotion of new and renewable energy sources for centralised and decentralised production, and their integration into the urban environment (ALTENER).
We are talking about the Hungarians, who rose up as long ago as 1956.
Under Heading 4: External Policies, we are in part consolidating existing measures.
(FR) The European Parliament is being consulted this week about the first formal strategy for 30 years on relations between the European Union and the Pacific.
We talk about improving the quality of training in Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, including the last speaker - perhaps the fact that he is a man has something to do with it - there is significant consensus among the political groups on this subject.
You are doing yourselves no favours, even as supporters of the European project, if you hand your taxpayers' money to these schemes with a 'Europe right or wrong' attitude, without stopping to look at whether it is being efficaciously spent or whether it is being lost or stolen.
(DE) Madam President, thank you for allowing me to make a personal observation at the end of this debate.
Why?
Last but not least, there has been absolutely no reference to our human rights policy, even though it is our brand image for the outside world and even though we have just managed to obtain a specific instrument for it.
Enterprises can access all the necessary information on European programmes and on the main national and regional players in the various Member States.
Furthermore, I believe that it prejudices a proper and legitimate aspect of intra-European trade, threatening to reduce the movement of literature across Europe to the level of pornography sent through the post, so I am reliably informed, in unmarked brown manilla envelopes, and in the free world reducing the legitimate trade in books to the level of smuggling in and out of eastern Europe of so-called subversive literature.
Furthermore, the President of the Eurogroup and the Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs are invited to take part, with the right to speak but not to vote, in the meetings of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, and we accept those invitations.
I am sure Commissioner Oreja, responsible for information, together with one of our Vice Presidents, Mr Anastassopoulos, has the resources necessary to let the truth shine through.
We welcome the rejection, by a slim, right-wing majority, of the Evans report on asylum.
What I said was the result of a report compiled by a delegation of the European Parliament that had just visited Huambo in Angola.
On the subject of sovereign debt, I advocated that the rating agencies should avoid pro-cyclicality in their work and take into account the forecasts of the main international financial institutions.
Many of us who have served loyally on the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries for many years have found ourselves sidelined in the interests of expediency.
I just have this feeling, personally, that they may be a little late.
A second central requirement of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is that the information society should be provided with a stable legal framework and that a higher degree of legal security should be guaranteed for all participants.
Several Slovak businesses have voluntarily pledged to observe the so-called Business Code of Ethics for the euro changeover.
Such an expert opinion, which has been based on information given by the company and the Swedish Government, involves highly sensitive information, which the company will certainly not disclose.
Mr President, in the course of your long political career, you have earned universal respect, not only throughout the African continent but also across the world, and, as the charismatic father of Senegal’s parliamentary opposition, you became a model for democrats across Africa.
This is, accordingly, a further directive forming part of the consumer protection package based on broader objectives that are intended to safeguard consumer confidence and to promote transnational and European business transactions.
I know that we require the commitment of the Member States, but do you not think that what we basically need is a political will which, until now, I have not seen from any quarter?
For the last vote of this parliamentary term we are being asked to give our verdict on the asylum package.
It is regretful that a limited number of countries, including Ireland, the UK and my own country, the Netherlands, do not go to the ballot boxes on the same day as other European Member States - namely Sunday - and that the sense of excitement is thus lost.
In the light of an inquiry at the time into the social and economic consequences of abolishing Community subsidies for tobacco cultivation, the decision was taken not to go down this path.
Erika Mann report (A4-0403/97)
In my view it fits in positively with the principle of subsidiarity.
I should also like to ask why you only plan to request information on the identity of third country nationals and not European Union nationals.
It is a situation in which they are making an enormous effort to maintain the education of their children and to feed their population, but which has already lasted more than 20 years.
- Before the vote:
I also share the opinion on the joint fight to eliminate child labour.
It has entered into a special partnership with the European Union.
I have dealt with questions on other occasions here in Parliament, and I would simply emphasize once again that we take the problems which have arisen as regards the Kola Peninsula very seriously.
In my opinion, one of the most important priorities for this Perspective should be to consolidate economic growth in the ten new Member States, which is currently experiencing an upturn, as this will facilitate cohesion and equality within the EU as a whole.
The Spanish authorities do not therefore need to wait for the Commission to give its decision before starting these projects, given that beginning the work will in no way prejudice the Commission’s decision on whether to grant Community financing.
The stance taken by European citizens and industry on these measures must be known and respected in order to be able to avoid any kind of abusive, anti-democratic behaviour.
Who were these people filming the demonstrators?
What I can tell you is that we have the TV Without Borders Directive, which tackles such issues, and we have our black list in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.
However, we also need to consider what happens on the first day of the post-Gaddafi era.
This is a sensitive issue with far-reaching political implications and one which needs further reflection.
If the European Citizens' Initiative is interpreted in such a way that only a few are able to take advantage of it, this will only exacerbate the situation.
It would be futile to suggest that the persistence of this situation does not undermine profoundly the mutual trust between the partners and the civil societies in the region, trust that is nonetheless vital to the success of our Euro-Mediterranean ambitions.
You spoke of tackling fraud and preventing money from being wasted.
It is possible to go beyond an approach of merely having a penalty mechanism, and that is why adoption of this economic governance package will lead to more Europe and better Europe.
In addition, counterfeit medicines can have life-threatening consequences for people who take these medicines unaware that they are counterfeit.
The European Union will continue to urge the current and future authorities in Yugoslavia to make progress towards that objective, but it will also have to make it perfectly clear to the Kosovo Albanians that it does not support their claims to independence.
Members of Parliament of course are at liberty to contest that, but I think it is very important that wherever we arrive in this, there is legal certainty.
It surprises me that we need a further three years for this, and the rapporteur has added another year on top of that.
One thing is certain: it is not possible to control human beings by law, but it is possible and indeed necessary to create the conditions in which they and their health can grow – mind, body and soul.
What we should be concentrating on is whether the salmon is genuinely safe.
I think, then, that I would have difficulties with us actually restricting this instrument to the internal market.
My colleague Mr Dimitrakopoulos, for whom I am deputizing here today, has also drawn up an excellent opinion which you will find in the same document. In this, he explains in great detail that regional integration does not conflict with the integration of world trade, but quite the opposite.
Aside from this aspect, however, which is in itself unacceptable on principle, the main cause for indignation is the instrumentalisation of the Charter against the Member States.
It may be that a more significant degree of harmonisation would have been better for the internal market.
Lastly, I regret the failure of the Council to reach agreement on the related draft Directive on Access to Justice, as endorsed by the EP with amendments on 31 March 2004, and I urge the Council and the Commission to redouble their efforts on this particular initiative.
Now we all know that without special treatment for agriculture we will not be able to guarantee a minimum of Community preference nor as a result, the primary producing role of agriculture.
They have not seen, or have not wanted to see, the serious problems which this rise in fuel costs presented for people obliged to use their cars or dependent upon domestic fuel oil.
Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with the two reports being debated today: Mrs Dybkjær' s report on progress so far, and Mrs Eriksson' s on the future. I found them both enormously interesting.
The Swedish Presidency is seeking to speed up capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
The Commission also intends to submit a proposal to the Council in the year 2000, i.e. this year, whereby the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, taking special account of child pornography on the Internet, will be declared to be punishable offences.
. Mr President, I am responding to Mr Martin’s reservations relating to the legal aspects, not to the substance.
Our thanks go to the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Portugal and Holland, and we hope that the remaining eight Member States will also consider their position.
We hope that the processes of dialogue, such as those which bring together former diplomats and academics from Armenia and Turkey, will lead to a common understanding based on scientifically-recognised historical facts.
That is what the Rapid Alert System is all about, and in that respect it worked very well.
Well, we are now clearly running the risk of turning human beings into commodities, at least in part, and this affects the very roots of our civilisation - in terms of Christianity and also of the enlightenment and Marxism.
This would truly be a shame.
However, for pressing schedule reasons, Mr President, this regulation absolutely must be adopted at first reading.
These include numerous events at national and international levels on the subjects of peace, justice and solidarity.
(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)
While the new Millennium will bring with it challenges for the WTO, it must also reflect development.
We learn therefore that "the European Central Bank has stated that it will not allow the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, to conduct internal investigations" and that "in its first report to Parliament, Council and Commission, the supervisory committee of OLAF called for legal proceedings to be brought against Community bodies that have not implemented Regulation 1073/99, before the end of 1999" and that "the Commission initiated legal proceedings at the European Court of Justice against the decision of 7 October 1999 of the European Central Bank regarding the non-application of Parliament and Council Regulation 1073/99" .
That is the reason why I, as rapporteur, recommend the compulsory depositing of every European film made for public distribution in the archives.
That again shows how much we need to invest in the European budget's operational capacities to react.
For example, major banks that betrayed the trust of their investors; international advisors, who often knowingly certified false accounts; monitoring bodies, which failed to monitor; and – if I may mention this, Commissioner – those governments that tolerate tax havens are also guilty.
The next item is the joint debate on:
The European Commission has confirmed this, as indeed did we last week, in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, without a single vote against.
Are the readmission agreements compatible with the obligations under international law, do they respect the principle of 'non-refoulement', on which the right to seek asylum depends?
There was a demand for a more global approach to mobility in the Schengen area, a demand which has been met by this Commission proposal for a directive.
A large part of US society is opposed to actions combating climate change.
In this respect too, we are mainly guided by the suggestions already made by the Commission.
We were able to work together productively, each putting forward his or her own points of view, and I would like to thank them for that.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is, I believe, the third or fourth debate on Chechnya in one year.
When I speak to you today, I convey the message of the Palestinian people to the peoples of a continent we have always been linked to with relations of neighbourliness and as a result of our historical links of cooperation and friendship and partnership and association in numerous sectors.
Mr President, we are in a tricky situation with one of our neighbours when a normally existing republic on the European continent is officially called non-existent - only 'the "former” Republic of M.' - by decision of the UN.
There are still very inflexible regulations, however, which are stifling economic activity.
Perhaps the clearest example of this is the fact that the EU's agricultural policy, which has been supranational for almost the longest time of all policy areas, is one of the most inefficient by far.
For I believe that is where the best chances lie for development, that we must exclude the long-distance approach from the outset and focus more on cooperation within these regions.
This is a subject, however, that I believe should continue to engage us and others - as the Commissioner has already said, and I have noted it - because the numbers are terrifying.
All he did was exercise his human rights.
In the United States as in Europe, politicians appear merely as servants of the global banking power.
Amendment 29 in particular will allow areas of the EU that are justifiably proud of the quality of their product to identify it as such.
I feel that this proposal is a step on the way to a rather better position for women.
I would therefore hesitate to create the impression that what happened to the insurance undertakings to which reference was made is of any particular relevance to the case of Lloyd's. My service is looking at the failures of the other two insurance companies.
Finally, as has been said by Mrs Ewing, Chernobyl is not a unique plant.
Provision has been made for Brazil and the EU only to be able to suspend or repudiate the agreement with regard to all Member States.
What is already happening in this field in certain countries, such as Portugal, Greece or Ireland, and which is of the utmost seriousness, are salary cuts and pension freezes, even on the lowest pensions and those below the poverty line.
Each person must accept responsibility for his or her own diet on the basis of his or her own assumptions.
If we do, the European Union will lose their trust, which will, in turn, affect progress in the negotiations for a new climate change treaty.
We therefore also need to provide legal immigration routes for people looking for work.
There has been very minor progress in a few areas. The greatest advances by far which, while not being enough, at least represent progress have come from the Croats.
For the last 20 or 30 years, we have been carrying with us the astonishing debts of the world's greatest power, and it is now up to the whole world to settle those debts.
One final remark by way of a conclusion.
In this way, a sensible measure to limit carbon dioxide emissions and thus combat climate change has become a burden for consumers and resulted in increasingly widespread social discontent.
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
Measures financed in this context, such as modernisation of hospital infrastructure, purchase of medical equipment or the training of medical staff can help improve citizens' access to healthcare, particularly in the poorest regions.
The future Commission will have a huge responsibility in helping Member States and the European Union's citizens overcome these hardships.
That is what I have done.
This was not just a matter of horse-trading among those Member States that struggled to meet the Pact’s standards; there was also discussion of economic policy and about what the Pact was meant to achieve in economic terms in the context of macro-economic policy.
If the Commission does not get active quickly enough, the whole project will end up in smoke.
What is therefore needed is a monetary and fiscal policy that will boost economic recovery and help combat unemployment.
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.
This is why I have voted against the Roszkowski report.
This does not only affect Spain, as the bordering country, but it also affects road traffic to Portugal, given that the Pyrenees pose such an obstacle.
It should be pointed out, however, that there is a long way to go on this issue, especially as regards implementing a common agricultural policy that respects the existing cultural diversity, whereby policies are put in place that promote small and medium-sized farming, in contrast with the current measures in place, which, if they achieve their aims, will sacrifice and penalise farmers with fewer resources.
They have more first-hand knowledge of social needs. They have more involvement in the problems and, furthermore, they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy, and thereby achieve better results.
What needs to be improved?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision against Radio 101 was revoked partly because those to whom that frequency was promised withdrew, but undoubtedly also because of the powerful solidarity with 101 that was apparent among the population, because the opposition parties, parts of the governing party and parts of the government itself declared in favour of it.
We have succeeded in bringing traditional forms of air pollution under control in the last ten years, thanks also to EU directives, but at the same time, the risk of changes to global weather patterns getting out of hand has grown.
We know how rapidly the world economy is changing and so we are also aware of the increasing importance of research and development, the value of cooperation between companies, and the need for companies to specialise, and hence also the need for specialisation agreements.
The co-funding of environmental aid is also something already happening.
Or, if there is to be a European referendum, then let there be, instead of 25 national referenda, one single European referendum, for example on whether to have a new constitution or stick with the old one.
This consensus applied not only in the institutions and the national governments but with the EU public as well.
Four points.
I believe, however, that we should nevertheless remember European producers.
This requires periodic reports about national activities and their effects.
What everyone is asking about is legal certainty.
The Commission is committed to effective and rapid follow-up to the Lisbon European Council - that is the least that might be expected of it.
Ten seconds of this I will use to express my sincere hopes for the success of your six month presidency, and to acknowledge your efforts in making your country a greater part of European construction.
Already the Manchester Regional Genetics Centre has received demands for royalty payments whenever it tests for the cystic fibrosis gene.
At the same time, we cannot but note the continuing lack of willingness to make comparable commitments in respect of other forms of export subsidy; as far as I am aware, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board was compensated for its latest losses by the Canadian Government.
Therefore, it is essential that the guidelines are clear and agreed at European level.
Europe is the largest energy importer in the world.
Just so you know!
As Greens, we are in favour of a policy of economic stimulation, but it must take the form of investment in the railways.

In my view, therefore, the request to the Commission to include in the first three-yearly report on the state of cohesion a clear and comprehensible definition of this concept, and to improve and broaden the indicators used to measure it, is a very important one.

Admittedly, we have already exchanged views on this matter on two occasions, firstly on 3 October, following an oral question from the Chairman of your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Giorgio Napolitano, and then on 24 October, when I came to Parliament to present the results of the informal European Council in Biarritz on 13 and 14 October, where, indeed, the Charter was one of the major items on the agenda.
However, the chaos and the oppression of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe has led to no satisfactory response from Zimbabwe's neighbours, who seem deaf to the cries of anguish from the oppressed people of that country.
One last remark: since logically we should like it to be laid down that exposure to benzene should ultimately be reduced as much as possible, it is essential that, after the year 2000 - and this is the proposal from the Committee on the Environment - the limit value for exposure should be reduced by a factor of 10, in other words to 0.1 part per million.
The other side of the coin is undoubtedly a certain price tag, but where no-one denies that there is a price to be paid for everything for respected self-employed entrepreneurs, all sorts of objections are raised when it comes to the assisting spouses of these entrepreneurs.
I have to say that the Commission is doing a truly creditable job on this in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina in general.
Throughout the first eight years of Macedonian independence, these frustrations were played on by the Social Democratic government of Mr Crvenkovski, who literally bought a few Albanians, a few quislings, by offering them marginal posts in his government and a few ambassadorial posts here and there.
Several items were entered on the agenda.
The future competitiveness of European animal husbandry may depend on how this problem is managed, and its cross-cutting nature calls for commitment and responsibility, through a coordinated approach and a shared political will.
I would like to point out that the English version is the correct one.
Because - and I agree with you on this point - the LEADER initiative is so important, the intention is that in the next planning period, more funds will be available for this successor programme as a Community initiative than in the current period.
Finally, I should like to point out that the WTO' s challenge is to continue to develop the multi-lateral trade system in such a way as to ensure that globalisation yields the best possible benefits for as many people and countries as possible.

My final word, Mr President, is this: if I had to write a report for Mr Duisenberg, it would say 'good, but could do better' .
I appeal to this House to support the resolution and for the European Union and the Commission to do everything possible to monitor and to assist in the process.

Cordless power tools have made building sites much safer and often in the case of power failure we rely on batteries for back-up lighting or emergency power.

Simplifying these variations will mean they are subject to the same criteria with regard to the authorisation, administrative management and supervision of the changes made, whatever the legal procedure may have been whereby the medicinal products were licensed.
Effective implementation of the reforms, especially those relating to the areas of democracy, rule of law and freedom of expression, remains a serious problem for these states and is dependent both on the political will of their authorities and on the degree of commitment from civil society and their citizens.

– Good evening, Mr President.
I should just like to make, as would the Members of my group, a few comments.

I am sure that in his home country of Ireland the situation is the same as in Scotland, where you have thousands of sheep going through in one day and each individual sheep has to be inspected and tagged as it goes through.
Therefore, I believe that this debate, and hopefully more to follow, will not only help in focusing the attention of all those who have to take the right decisions, but will also help European citizens to be informed about the continued existence of this problem.
As regards the connection with the European arrest warrant and the International Criminal Court, I believe that, where there is a choice, the Member States must be free to choose between requests for extradition by the United States and requests to hand people over under the European arrest warrant or from the International Criminal Court, but I would like you to inform us of the positions in the Council.
I do not think we have the right legislation for applying this principle of competence to the regional bodies, in order to allow them to manage the cohesion funds and the structural funds.

We must state that poverty, injustice or conflict are not causes which can justify barbarism.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although this debate has been prompted by oral questions to the Commission, in substance it is the natural continuation of an initiative that Parliament undertook some time ago and which it has recently been emphasising. It is clear that we need an action plan to improve the situation of the Roma, given this minority's poor integration into the social and civil framework of the countries of the European Union.
We are giving ourselves time to see whether this urgency is in fact taken into account.
Accordingly, I welcome the measures put forward in this proposal aimed at addressing the lack of clarity of the existing texts and at making the wording simpler, as this would bring the interested parties closer together and would lead to the fisheries sector identifying more closely with the legislation.
I will, therefore, confine myself to three issues: terrorism, Europe and the world.

In Italy, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, the post office, not the government, provides this free service.
The mandate entrusted to the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for drawing up the draft treaty may not be ideal, but it is the fruit of a difficult compromise, gathering together Member States whose differences one feared had become intolerable.
This was the whole point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten
– Mr President, Commissioner, although education in the Union is the responsibility of the Member States, there are many channels in the European Union for the support of cultural education in schools.

The mismatch between young people's qualifications and the needs of the labour market is one of the reasons why Lithuania has such a terribly high rate of youth unemployment (34%).

Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes very much the official visit to North Korea and to Seoul by the Council, Commission and the High Representative of the CFSP.
The ideas I believe we have been working on in recent times are the following: firstly, Europe can be - in fact it is, has been and can continue to be in the future - a reception country, because people can without doubt earn a good living here and because furthermore - let us not deceive ourselves - there is a great amount of activity by many people which contributes to the economic growth of our countries.
We also hope for better times in this respect.
Almost 150 years ago, appropriately here in Brussels, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels drew up their manifesto in which they called for the democratic parties in all countries to join together and to reach agreement.

Increasingly, terrorism stems from the activities of networks operating at international level, which have very close links with other types of organised crime based in several countries, exploiting the legal loopholes arising from the geographical limits of investigations and sometimes enjoying extensive logistical and financial support.
. (PT) We could only vote in favour of this report, given that what is at stake is financing a high common level of consumer protection, effective enforcement of consumer protection rules, and the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies, even though this report looks no further than questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products, protecting the economic interests of consumers, and promoting consumer organisations at European level, as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies relevant to their interests.
Honourable Members, Mrs Péry, the President-in-Office, has given us a superb analysis of the priorities of the French Presidency, which we all believe will be particularly important priorities.
Yet the tremendous support which was expressed in the House during the speeches puts me under an additional obligation, because I understand that we stand before great challenges, and we must overcome them all.
How can this be combined with the liberalisation or maintenance of the quota system?
Thirdly, and this is of utmost importance, there is a reference in the new directive to the need to have independent media authorities at national level.

Penalties that appear to be a slap on the wrist will not help the financially weak countries and will inevitably impede the integration process.

It coincides with a greater liberalisation of exchanges, with an increase in US competition, resulting from the increased support stemming from the Farm Bill and, in cases such as rice, from the increase in imports resulting from the application of the Everything but Arms initiative.
We regret that this is not the case at the moment.
Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end, I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament, as well as José Manuel Barroso, who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June.
I find the neo-colonial behaviour on the part of the United Kingdom, which solved the problem by replacing a 'Z' with an 'X' on a piece of paper using correction fluid or an eraser, very strange.

Acting on our proposal, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is calling for the development of postal services to be coupled with an improvement in the living and working conditions of postal workers.

Mr Barroso, your political guidelines provide little illumination as to your plans and drag out much of the same rhetoric used five years ago.

Mr President, on that last vote, I would just like to inform the House that the Commission issued a press release yesterday and Commissioner Reding spoke last night to the effect that, as regards the report we have just passed and agreed on mobility for teachers, students, academics, others involved in education, and helping them to move around Europe to study, to work and everything else related to the education field, the Commission will not accept the amendments which ask them to do something to enforce these arrangements.
The main reason for this is our group' s criticism of the way in which the Council used the procedure laid down in Article 133 as the basis for its decision to apply for the appointment of a panel to examine whether section 211 of the U.S. Trademark Act is incompatible with the TRIPS Agreement.
It is high time, because our political project cannot go on being so remote from the people.

That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government.
But they could join forces with a majority with an alternative plan for conversion from driftnets in the Atlantic - a plan financed from the FIFG which could in the course of 1997 and 1998 finance: first the cost of the investment already made in driftnets; secondly training for fishermen in more selective methods of fishing for the same species - tuna; thirdly the investment needed for conversion.
Even in a high-tech country like Japan, the promised safety levels could not be even remotely achieved.
It is all well and good for it to congratulate itself on progress made during the past five years, particularly with regard to the establishment of a common asylum and immigration policy, the harmonisation of border controls and improvements to judicial cooperation, yet it would have only been fair to include references to the obstacles which certain Member States have placed in the way of progress in the field of justice and to note that only a minimum level of harmonisation in the field of asylum has been achieved.
The European Union will continue to be a success story, provided it preserves its dynamism, proving that it is a political world actor with ever-increasing importance, and I would add - a political importance.
Wednesday:
The second point is that we must bear in mind the interests of the pharmaceutical industry which is conducting the clinical trials.

People today have the good fortune to be able, at long last, to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible.
What has been included, though, is a long-term goal of 95 g/km by 2020, which I am pleased about, but it depends on the interpretation to what extent this has been included effectively in the current text.

From now on, fishing activities in these specific areas will require a permit and be subject to a prior assessment, which will be carried out by the Member State, to ensure that they will not cause any significant damage.
My fifth point is that, although we have discussed the threat of bioterrorism in our committees and at our part-sessions, I wonder whether we are prepared for the inevitable spread of some of the diseases mentioned in this report.

So the only answer is to have competitive markets, which have to be enforced by strong and independent regulators, strong competition authorities and full ownership unbundling.
It has become apparent to us - and they are finding this very difficult in the area that I come from - that because of the way in which deposit money is levied on single-use packaging in Germany - and shortly in Belgium too - it has actually become impossible at the moment to continue importing single-use packaging from other European countries into Germany.
They are the first step towards finding collective parliamentary institutions to work with collective governmental and administrative developments such as ASEM.
This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of the fragile market situation for salmon.

Mr President, I shall not repeat the sad history of this dossier.
We do not have to decide yet on moving certain countries from group II to group I. That will come next year and not just in six months' time either, because we cannot expect the Commission to report every six months.

. (ES) The fact that the process of European integration is at such a decisive point, as a result of the enlargement under way, on the one hand, and the new political and economic challenges facing the EU, on the other, demands the cooperation of both the European Parliament and the parliaments of the Member States so that the citizens, via their legitimate representatives, may participate in this process.
I share your views on this matter completely and I am extremely doubtful about the idea of liberalising these sectors.

I also think that it is right that we are responding after the various accidents, and that European citizens should see that Parliament and the European institutions not only look after them when there has been a disaster, but that having learned these lessons, they are capable of moving forward and making progress on the legislative aspects.
Can you confirm that it will not have a delaying effect?

It is therefore unlikely that an international agreement would now be able to gain approval from the US Congress.
It is time for all that to end before it ends in more violence.
Mr President, in a democracy, transparency is a concept of honour.
This is the sort of lie they tell: ' If you took the measures that are necessary we would live in a life of dimming lights, turning off air conditioning, sacrificing our industrial competitiveness and curtailing our economic growth' .
I think that I can, on behalf of the Council, and certainly on behalf of the Presidency, express our full solidarity with Mrs Aubenas, and with all the hostages in Iraq, because there are others.
I hope that this is also included in the package, therefore.
This is all ludicrous and it is completely unacceptable that animals are tortured for this sort of excuse.
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.
We have only to think about the reasons for annulling a marriage and for divorce and the conditions of marriage and divorce.
Moreover, 34 decisions relating to Article 171 have still to be implemented.
The only thing is, Commissioner, that this financial plan has been agreed to by the Commission, and also - and this I have to say with bitter regret - by this House, which has gone along with this extortion in order not to put the European Union's financial future at risk.
This report, which deals with most aspects of the Union's regional policy, does not, in my opinion, give enough weight to the less developed regions.
On the other hand, immediate cessation of bombardments by Israel and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the security zone in South Lebanon.
(RO)I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr. Costa and all colleagues that took part in the negotiations relating to the third reading.
Although the basis on which this will be done is laid down in an appropriate way in the directives that we will be voting on the day after tomorrow, it remains incumbent on the Commission to keep a very watchful eye on market developments.
The funds are distributed for EU projects and policies in all Member States, admittedly, in varying proportions.
Similarly, we support every amendment that strengthens the directive in terms of authorisation procedure and of the public's right to information.
The wording about the principle of public access to official records looks to be very feeble.
It is also important to point out the Union’s commitment to the Palestinian people, even though I believe that we need to broaden this commitment politically at a time when the Union should be calling on Israel not only to improve the conditions for passing through and entering the West Bank and Gaza, but also to do away with that hateful barrier that fragments the Palestinian territory, divides local communities – and, in some cases, family units – and disrupts, if not completely destroys, a great many local Arab economies.
Firstly, we want the Commission to state here that there will be a framework directive on food and to tell us what the timetable for that directive would be.
Reducing ship emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases is a priority for the Commission, since we know that if measures are not taken, by 2020, ships in European Union seas will emit more air pollutants than all land-based sources combined.
There are two reasons for this. Firstly, because we have adopted extremely urgent measures which are already being applied in advance, and secondly, because part of the Erika I and Erika II packages are already in force and are obliging, for example, countries which have not been carrying out port controls, to do so.
One thing I ask of the President-in-Office of the Council: talk to the new candidates and negotiate with them!
If we take that prospect - which is not unlikely - our aim and our duty are to avoid that recession.
The application of this legislation should be a priority for all Member States which, while simultaneously subject to control and monitoring by the Commission, will guarantee that it has the desired positive outcomes for the citizens of Europe.
The EU cannot reasonably meet all the wishes of the candidate countries.
Is everyone happy now?
We have our own regulation concerning liability if a producer manufactures a defective product, and indeed under the terms of that regulation, any producer who sells a defective product is held liable.
Therefore, at European level, this procedure has to be stronger than it is today.
Persons acting as contact points should certainly have good foreign language skills in at least one other EU language and should have gained experience in international cooperation in criminal matters as well as have served as a judge, public prosecutor or other official in the justice system.
In today's world, a country's image is an important part of the way it operates within the global economy, and in terms of international cooperation.
First of all, labour inspection services, employers' organisations, trade unions.
Madam President, in my own name and on behalf of my political party, the Coalición Canaria [the Canary Islands Coalition], I would like to make public in this House my rejection and condemnation of the murder of Councillor Jesús María Pedrosa.
Transport safety is now at the top of the political agenda of the fifteen governments of the European Union. It is rightly the case as too many innocent persons lose their lives as a result of inadequate transport measures.
Terrorism has social roots and therefore needs a social response.
Mr President, I can clear up Mr Cohn-Bendit’s confusion.
We need to develop these relations with the clear understanding that there are much more things that unite us than those that divide us.
If we do not want to give vain hope to the millions of people still unable to benefit from the most essential medicines, more - much more - will be needed than a mechanism whose practicability is and remains highly dubious.

In spite of everything, they were better than the original wordings and would thus, if accepted, improve the report as a whole.
(DE) Mr President, I should like to make a technical observation.
I first highlighted the serious lack of reliable data at my meeting with the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Mr Otunnu, in December 2000.
I have to say - and there is no point in not calling a spade a spade - that I think the amount of resources we have committed to the European fight against drugs as distinct from the fight Member States engage in individually that the European Union budget is feeble in relation to the extent of the problem.
Although we do not have the necessary powers to dictate to one Member State what the content of its fundamental law should be, we cannot act with indifference to this anti-democratic abuse.
As this is such an important matter, however, I will mention that these countries were Cyprus, Lithuania, Malta, Bulgaria and Luxembourg.
However, I also entirely agree with what the rapporteur has said, that this article must naturally be a codecision article in the future, not one of the kind it is at present.
Mr President, the fight against organized crime ranks high on the political agenda in Europe today.
Yes, the Austrian Presidency is talking about subsidiarity and bureaucracy and the Court of Justice, but the citizens are not.
But any legislation is only as good as its enforcement.
That is what we are trying to do with the amendments that have been put forward from our side.
I find myself in concurrence with his view, both as to the importance of this issue and to the fact that we need to persevere.
Naturally - and I actually do not understand why Mr Cabrol is so much against it - we are in favour of Amendment No 2 to make no exception for a given category of motor vehicles for one year.
Cohesion is the other face of the single market and monetary union. In that context, and in the context of enlargement, economic and social cohesion will be needed more than ever, and rightly so.
In this context the Swedish Presidency should initiate a Europe-wide debate on the subject of the role of the national parliaments of all the 27 Member States, and should develop a new model of cooperation between sovereign European nations.
And we all agree that this is something that must be condemned.
In development specifically it has included the legally-binding, contractual participation laid down in the Cotonou Agreement, a principle that we believe should be extended to the EU's relationship with all regions of developing countries in the world.
It will be interesting to hear how you envisage your service developing in this direction.
The Portuguese example of delocalising businesses is just a drop in the ocean, but it is representative.
It has to be noted that within our institutional framework - which has been ratified by our people, our parliaments and our authorities - the current Treaty gives the European Central Bank power and independence without democratic accountability.
The environment is difficult, politically, and in every other sense of the word.
As you know, the proposals had to be tabled by 31 March.
Safety of our environment and avoidance of energy poverty among those people, particularly in the South-East of England who live on fixed incomes, are equally important objectives.

I believe he was right to mention it because it is probably the most famous and popular programme.
It provides an excellent basis for Community measures in the area of research and development for the next seven years.
The strategy may serve as a model for how, in the enlarged EU, we meet challenges related to specific regions - in order ultimately to strengthen the EU as a whole.
Secondly, an enhanced understanding of how natural systems and the eco-system work so that companies’ product and business models might be adapted along biological lines.
However, that is a very inconsistent approach, firstly because the right to life and human dignity apply from the very beginning, and secondly because the creation of a cloned embryo is the decisive technical step on the way to the emergence of a cloned baby.
There is potential both in the European Union and globally, but it will never replace all the oil we use.
I hope you will remedy this lack.
We need to develop a new policy that is adapted to the new challenges.
I think that this is certainly the most important aspect of the EU budget.
A report on the effects of the agri-environmental measures is also needed for the forthcoming WTO negotiations.
This must be made much more of in our efforts to reach a stage where everything will happen within the framework of a free market.
The Commission is aware of the fact that the European Parliament considers it important to know the names of the recipients of the largest sums.
I did not think it possible in such a short space of time, and I think that we can all be proud of the way you managed to achieve this.
I think it is very important that the reports should be as accurate as possible.
I am not calling for subsidies to be abolished.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask three questions.
From a different angle, on the matter of the budgetary resources relating to some of our programmes to which I, personally, am very attached, I shall be asking the European Parliament, as a budgetary authority, to take every care to ensure that sufficient resources are provided.
(Loud applause)
In addition, the Commission is aware of the matter to which the honourable member of the European Parliament refers in connection with the different policies followed by the different Member States in terms of the facility to replace one drug perhaps marketed as a patent medicine by a generic medicine, but this issue is one which is addressed by the Member States themselves.
We too note with concern the ageing of the population, the rising costs of social security schemes and the changes in family life.
Our joint amendments, on which we will be voting tomorrow, are aimed above all at improving the way in which the directive will be implemented, without jeopardising the achievement of the recycling targets, which are so important in terms of environmental policy.
We can only revive the economy by pursuing the Lisbon process: raising the retirement age is a necessary reform, we need to give an answer to our children so that there is a system which guarantees their future in 10, 20, 30, 40 years’ time.
The European Union will assist you in your peacemaking enterprise, and shall promote the strengthening of relations between the European Union and Colombia.
It is degrading for a country when its name appears at the top of such a blacklist.
As for the south-eastern borders of Europe, there has indeed been some delay in the promotion of cross-border cooperation, as the Myller report points out.
When the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted, we were promised a European area in which all freedoms would be present and effective and in which we would be protected from all insecurity.
If these attacks are based on a lack of arguments or on demagoguery, we must respond to them.
I fear that the proposal to prepare another report on progress achieved in eliminating barriers in a year’s time simply amounts to a further postponement of such action.
What we did manage to achieve though, and what pleased me enormously, was that we were able to make it abundantly clear that special regulations must be introduced for religious communities, because we must make it possible for people to identify with the idea behind and the fundamental aims of these communities.
The war on terrorism must nevertheless not become an all-encompassing incantation.
Greater responsibility for planning, administration, execution and funding must be devolved to the regional and local authorities than has hitherto been the case.
That is what Social Democracy stands for - we are not afraid of reforms.
This is a compromise, and it will enable us to restore peace to the troubled waters of the Bay of Biscay.
The objective of the legislative amendments that have been tabled is to simplify and modernise existing rules and innovation in the sector in readiness for future challenges.
We wish to express once more our condolences to the numerous victims, and we hope that Europe is able to help bring relief as soon as possible.
In many cases, therefore, they improve their control measures as soon as the Commission's auditors inform them of any shortcomings.
Our group supports preparations for enlargement to the east.
In a recent policy paper the Irish Government committed itself to reducing landfill and increasing the use of more sustainable means of waste disposal.
Is this pipe dream not based on a huge overestimation of the human race?
I would ask the President-in-Office to convey that message at the Summit.
In short, we can improve Europe through less Eurocratic powers and meddling, less Eurocratic red tape and less bureaucracy.
That is why we have nothing to lose by taking precautionary measures during the changeover.
There are best practices, specifically in Portugal, as regards crèches and nursery schools, improving maternity, paternity and parental leave systems, as well as policies to balance family and working life.
Should you agree, perhaps you might be accompanied by an independent expert who would undertake a detailed examination of the installation and subsequently report back to Parliament.
It goes without saying that Members of this Parliament, irrespective of whether they come from the social democratic, populist, liberal or green camp, also have the same hope.
Action absolutely has to be taken in Ireland to comply with our directives.
With regard to training, we need to adjust work skills to the demands of the new economy and to do so in a way that is economically accessible for workers and businesses.
Europe needs more than ever to devote significant resources to structural cohesion policies, as well as to policies focused on innovation, research and SMEs – in short, to policies that will support the emergence of a People's Europe and the spread of Europe’s influence in the world.
Great political and institutional confusion has arisen.
European manufacturers have now gained a huge amount of experience of recycling.
But what should be done now?
Responsibility for developing the initiatives and putting forward further measures now rests with the European Commission.
The Europe 2020 strategy proposes bringing the employment rate for the 20-64 age group up to 75% and reducing the number of people at risk of poverty.
This is a very strong mandate and a very strong principle which will inform the first reading of the 2007 budget in the European Parliament.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I am speaking on my own behalf, and I would like to say to my opposite number: in my view, nuclear technology is no solution and is also not, as far as I am concerned, a renewable energy source.
It was a political statement, in fact, not a personal one.
You have now said there are intensive controls, but - if I understood that correctly - foreign missions are unnecessary because we find bad conditions there anyway.
In relation to countries with greater financial difficulties, the way we play it must involve solidarity and cohesion.
'Conservation of tuna'!
The prospect of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon will increase this trend spectacularly.
Every five years elections are held but only three parties are allowed to take part in them.
We would like more research in this area.
They have no rights, no insurance, no pension credits, no sick pay and no security.
It is intolerable that all this is happening on our doorstep.
On the economic front, GDP growth raced ahead by 30% in 2002, with a figure of 20% expected in 2003.
On the other hand, the German Chancellor appears to be softening his dogmatic initial positions, having indicated during a visit to Bratislava some days ago that he might be prepared to accept the loud calls for the Commission to be appointed on the basis of one Commissioner per Member State, with equal rights.
That solution must be acceptable to all the interested parties, so that any other unpleasant developments can be averted.
As a Commissioner, I have tried to ensure that every level of our society takes its responsibilities seriously. That also includes, for instance, our media industries.
It is thanks to the principle of mutual recognition that the Union has achieved major successes, including the European arrest warrant, and all this is a blueprint for a true area of criminal justice.
The security implications of a collapse of the Pakistan State would be devastating to the security of the entire developed world.
. The Commission’s interpretation of the ruling of the ECJ on the Marks [amp] Spencer case is fully in compliance with the ECJ’s ruling.
Simplifying procedures, tackling the problems of island ports such as the excessive costs produced by market limitations, or how to facilitate new infrastructures through trans-European networks and the Structural and Cohesion Funds: these are measures which would contribute to improving the economic development and competitiveness of islands.
What contempt for democracy!
Thank you for answering the question, but, colleagues, I will read you the Rule because we must know about it.
Nice is not, at heart, about enlargement but about shifting power from electors and elected representatives to officials and ministers.
Our group rejects this nomination.
In planning the budget, significant attention must also be focused on the consequences of the financial crisis, still being felt by many countries, and efforts to effectively remove these.
I would add that, structurally speaking, a total weight of 44 tonnes or 40 tonnes makes no difference to the infrastructure whatsoever.
Nonetheless, the fact that all these countries are still not participants in the court has neither damaged, nor caused a cooling-off in, bilateral relations.
We thereby hope to achieve the intended effect of reducing the environmental burden imposed by the aviation industry.
Let us, for once, address the people of Tunisia directly to tell them that the European Parliament will not fall into the trap set for it by Mr Ben Ali by continuing to accommodate a dictatorship that is no longer even attempting to disguise itself.
The main element in this strategy of rapprochement will be the accession partnership which is currently being prepared and which will set out the short- and medium-term priorities which Turkey must meet, in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria, in the political, economic and Community acquis areas.
Discussions and specific actions concerning nuclear energy are inevitable.
The Commission will comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control and look at these questions in detail in the course of this year.
Over the last ten years, we have had to listen to a great many speeches about bloody conflicts around the world, but I think we can say without cynicism that a war waged against the soul and culture of a people can ultimately be more devastating than a purely military conflict.
I believe that we should be evaluating the European Union's joint strategy from June 1999 - to which Mr Oostlander has already referred - in a much more critical light.
The dish proposed tries to please everyone.
As far as I know, no problems have, at least so far, arisen involving other Member States.
The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries.
(PT) I would like to draw your attention to the desperate situation in the Western Sahara.
The United Kingdom experience was so rapid that the large loss of jobs and the difficulties associated with unbundling came over far too short a period.
However, equal access to health care must be available to everyone, without exception.
In my country, Poland, a report was published last week on aid in 2007.
Indeed, some people went as far as to say it was arbitrary, so we are calling for the publication of votes on an anonymous basis.
The Commission's response will be based on current legislative provisions, taking account of the budget available.
The debate is closed.
It seems to me that if we are going to appeal to the young and to society at large, we have to get back to the basic purpose of sport.
I should like to hear the Commission's response to this proposal in our resolution, because thorough and timely application of Article 171 is something which has hitherto been absent.
Mr President, this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the report.
Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal.
Above all, there must be close cooperation between judicial and financial police authorities to ensure that the economic systems that revolve around these criminal activities are blocked at source and all ramifications cut off.
Secondly, Mr Barón Crespo – and I would like once again to express my high regard for him – has said that we should not deliberate or vote on Eurostat and a dismissal.
The basic problem with batteries and accumulators has nothing to do with the energy they produce, but rather with the materials that they contain – cadmium, lead and mercury.
I cannot forget that this statement was made in relation to the so-called 'strategic reserve' and the possible failure to conclude an interinstitutional agreement.
My group welcomes the fact that the requirement and the procedure for issuing entry visas will speed up entry for large numbers of people.
Let us work together on that basis.
It is misleading our own citizens and our allies to suggest that the development of an autonomous EU military capability has anything to do with reinforcing NATO or is motivated by the desire to work in close partnership with the United States.
We would not be able to build peace, and without peace and security, development cannot take hold.
(DE) Mr President, fewer and fewer people are spending their entire working life with the same employer, so they need to be able to adapt without any problems to changing living and working conditions.
We checked for the last two years and the Court of Auditors was not present.
That is why I have tabled an amendment to raise this to EUR 10 000.
The first is the lack of openness in our dealings with Turkey, which is why I hesitate about the wording of paragraphs 1 and 29 of Mr Swoboda's report holding out the prospect of membership once again, whereas all the facts and every practical consideration indicate that this is misleading.
I think it is important in this case that it is the Committee on Development Cooperation which has itself seen that there should be a report about this.
If the Council concludes that Turkey is not fulfilling its obligations, it will take the appropriate steps.
A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue.
The general system for the recognition of diplomas and other educational qualifications was adopted in 1989 (between 1991 and 1994, 11, 000 people obtained recognition of their diplomas).
That includes access to documents, not only for the citizens of Europe but also for the Ombudsman.
(RO) I believe that the initiative on banning the use of cyanide-based technology in gold mining is unjustified.
Having said this, I would like to ask the Council to act quickly so that the final version of the text, which I hope will be voted for tomorrow, can be made available as soon as possible.
I agree with him that it is highly appropriate for the provisions of the Athens Convention of 1974 relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea to be incorporated into European law, since the national differences that still exist do not make it possible to guarantee an adequate level of liability and mandatory insurance in the event of accidents involving passengers.
Tremendous strains are being put on Member States such as the United Kingdom as a result of uncontrolled, unlimited and indiscriminate immigration resulting from continued EU enlargement.
First of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur.
I therefore support the rapporteur, who says that women's poverty and social exclusion in Europe require concrete, diverse and gender-based policy solutions, and accordingly, I also supported the raising of this issue with my vote.
We are faced with a similar problem in regard to research.
We must show solidarity, of course, but it must not be a one-way street.
Many of these inequalities are reproduced through the imbalances in the labour markets and the bias against women in many segments and in many institutions within the labour market.
No matter how desirable it would be to have more precise detail, in fact too much is still being left open because there is a statement at the end of the communication to the effect that the communication, which was drawn up in response to a judgment of the Court of Justice, can ultimately only be finally and conclusively judged by the Court of Justice.
In my opinion, this can no longer be due to a shortage of time.
If the price of gold fell below 100 euros per coin by weight, new coins would be produced, that is counterfeited, and if the price of gold exceeded the nominal value, the coins would be melted down and disappear from circulation.
It aims to introduce reliable and transparent identification and registration regulations for beef, as well as labelling for beef.
Once again this damage is caused by permissiveness, which, while it may satisfy the mania of some, remains a source of unhappiness for many others.
Let me, in conclusion, also express on behalf of the Commission, our great sadness at the accident that was reported earlier.
My second point is that the trans-European networks are also connected with employment. It is not just a question of building a road or a tunnel, or whatever it may be, but of binding Europe together, just as in the Roman Empire, but in rather different terms.
This issue bears some relation to the consideration of Russia as a market economy.
However, decisions on education must be made by the Member States. It is certainly not within the competence of the EU, despite the wish that it should be.
Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes
Amendment No 27 would have allowed an explicit derogation to allow this to continue, alongside prescription-only medicines.
I therefore voted to abstain on this report.
Another is to improve communication and more effectively target information to cover specific information gaps.
Given this essential role of the Community Customs Code, our group cannot understand the Commission's proposal to eliminate or minimise the role of Member States in the procedure for implementing the Community Customs Code.

We will support him by putting our votes behind the clear commitment made by the group leaders earlier this year.
We do not need to duplicate facilities already available from the American GPS, and we certainly should not inflict so much unnecessary carbon pollutant upon this environment.
The European Union has granted the countries of the Western Balkans exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products.
I would highlight in this respect certain projects developed with the support of the EQUAL programme which I have had the opportunity to experience in Portugal.
However, we believe that the projects in which women participate have been and still are inadequate, and this must be a requirement in the remaining programmes and in future ventures.
– Mr President, the Vaxholm case is another example of the great risks we run when we in this way allow our pluralistic Europe slowly to be squeezed out in our efforts to standardise.
I hope that the High Representative will insist on permanent observer status for the EU at the next ministerial meeting in April next year in Greenland.
This proposal is another step in this direction and therefore is to be rejected in the strongest possible terms.
Contrary to statements in the report, competition is not detrimental to the financing of public needs.
It is a new step towards a truly reunited Europe, based on mutually accepted principles of democracy and the rule of law.
This is a very serious issue and we need serious people making serious decisions.
First of all, Commissioner, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the preparations you have made in terms of following up this project, in view of the European Parliament’s position.

I am convinced that the standards presented this year will allow standards to be raised in subsequent years.
The good news is that the EU is uniquely well placed to take the lead on climate change and that, if we were to take up that challenge, we might also find that our own institutions are revitalised and that the EU is reconnected with the citizens it is supposed to represent.
Yes, the intergovernmental method, in which one blockage appears after another, is close to collapse and this is not going to be belied by the Treaty being presented on the cheap at Nice.
Tourism also makes for land conservation and better protection of the environment, the fact of the matter being that, with the creation of world heritage sites, we now give serious thought to areas that are to be protected, without however being set piously apart, so enabling them to be exploited ‘intelligently’ for tourist purposes.
9.
The June communication now tells us that the Commission is considering how the system is to look in the future and that the tasks of the lawyers concerned are perhaps to be transferred to national administrations.
If we spent just part of the money on demonstrating what we want to achieve with it, namely that we have a European obligation to peace, not only in the interests of our identity as a group, but also more generally for our public image and our image in Israel and Palestine, then our aid would be much more efficient.
When we debate road safety, there are certain Members of this House with an interest in this issue – and I will name Mr Vatanen specifically – who evidently think that the only things that matter are those things that have to do with costs and the installation of electronic gadgetry.
The debate is closed.
Children deserve special provisions and appropriate legal protection.
One of the defects in the system is not only that we often get presented with a fait accompli but that we do not get a chance to go to the country concerned.
Atomic weapons are weapons of mass destruction and the USA is demonstrating to us right now the methods it would use against weapons of mass destruction.
They will overburden businesses and will obviously result in job losses and in cost increases for consumers.
What is at issue here is the knowledge-based society, involving research, education and health care.
What that summit in Lisbon represented was a giant deceit and an attempt to impose upon the peoples of Europe a constitution just by dropping that word and repackaging it, when it actually has all the same proposals.
The main debates concern the Romanian Hungarians in particular, because this native national community, despite the provisions enshrined in the relevant convention of the Council of Europe, would not represent a majority in any of the new administrative units and would lose its rights to set up a local government.
Could not the Commissioner institute the gathering of statistics on this to see whether something should be done about it – possibly to encourage the Member State concerned to ensure that as many as possible of our main trunk routes are four-lane – for example, the Perth-to-Inverness trunk route?
We ought to start with these.
Amendment 7 draws attention to the fact that some Latin American countries gained additional benefits after the WTO agreement through negotiating free trade agreements and that these agreements further weaken the position of ACP countries.
Cooperation between Mr Lukashenko and Mr Saakashvili looks like political fiction and political horror combined.
I wish we could soon be in a position to say something similar about Famagusta, which is symbolic of a brutal expulsion that is both contrary to international law and a violation of human rights, as brutal as it is senseless; yet it could, without difficulty, and by one simple act of goodwill, be made a symbol of the downfall of nationalism and expulsion, one whose impact would be felt a long distance away from Cyprus.
However, the world has moved on and we need a public debate.
The Blak report contains many positive statements with regard to the Commission.
The EIT is a fascinating future project for cooperation, innovation and research, and the private sector will help ensure that higher education institutions are involved. This will be a real challenge for the future for European competitiveness.
Let us reflect, however, on ways of encouraging our transatlantic partners to recognise and apply the humanitarian principles.
Mr Blak, scrutiny of the agencies now covers a very broad spectrum of different activities, and your work, for which the Commission thanks you, was therefore very wide ranging.
Our Group believes the United States to be an essential partner in the fight against terrorism, but at the same time we think that the US Administration must respect the political subjectivity and powers of the European Union, as enshrined in our Treaties.
This will give us more legal possibilities.
Is Euromediterranean policy not experiencing a major downturn?
The amendment has also been entered in the Minutes.
These three religions, which have so overwhelmingly given the world its shape over the past millennia, must find in themselves the strength to achieve a peaceful solution in that centre which was their source, so that people adhering to these three faiths may be able to live together in the city that is holy to them all, Jerusalem.
Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death.
I shall give one specific example, though there are others, of this great tendency to resort to hackneyed arguments which paralyse people and prevent the public authorities from acting in good time.
So I wonder what the point of the decision was.
In August 2007, the United States modernised the Visa Waiver Programme by adding certain conditions to further enhance security.
The shortage of blood and plasma is a well-known problem in Europe.
Joint motion for a resolution on reform of the common organization of the market in olive oil
We also have one of the highest mobile penetration rates.
It is recognized here that the US has a more entrepreneurial culture but I believe there are three more concrete reasons.
Mr Poettering’s second point, in which he mentioned anti-terrorism in the same breath as asylum and immigration, struck me as combining two quite different phenomena in a dangerous way.
Now, we are discussing how the EU can work with the OSCE to develop monitoring of the border with the Northern Caucasus. The Troika' s visit to the Caucasus in February and to Israel and Gaza in the past two days is another example of the EU' s role in conflict prevention.
Naturally, it would help if crop yields were higher - but this is not, I repeat, not the essence of the hunger problem.
Therefore, this is a good moment to progress beyond unwanted moralizing and criticism, and say that when it comes to things that affect people, not everything is acceptable in this Europe ruled by merchandise, where some people try to turn women into a commodity.
For example, living next to a shooting range, with the type of noise produced there, may be a very unpleasant experience even if the range is rarely in use.
Is there a clear cross-border dimension?
Especially at a time when the United States has just approved an agricultural policy in which they increase their subsidies and especially when it is widely known that this new American policy is heightening the depression in world prices.

I already have one for it. Last week, a pilot with the company FlyAir took a defective aircraft back to Paris-Orly airport, but, instead of giving him credit for this, the airline gave him the sack.
I also believe that it would be reasonable to build our future action upon existing initiatives such as the European Code against Cancer or the Council Recommendations on screening for breast, cervical and colon cancer, which are already a good basis for action.
By banning the trade in arms and by funding refugee programmes, the EU continues to stand by the Burmese people and their human rights and fundamental freedoms.

It must also be made illegal for EU citizens or companies to trade in fish caught by flags-of-convenience vessels.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
When will they reply?
We ourselves do not, so we can expect that they will do likewise.
It is my impression, Mr President, that we are in for some surprises, since I fear that, if we carry on with this policy over a long period, enlargement will take place much later than is politically desirable, and we, as the European Parliament, must bear this in mind.
The industry is being paid huge amounts in compensation and we are getting very little in return.
In any event, the Commission is willing and able to see what measures can be taken with the means available to help resolve the Transdnistrian conflict.
I am convinced that further work in close cooperation with the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, will lead to a balanced solution offering a clear benefit for the environment and the internal market, while minimising additional burdens to SMEs.
(PT) The essential problem of developing countries with regard to energy - in contrast to the situation in more developed countries - is not the replacement of current production sources with other, less polluting ones.
Are the Member States prepared to accept the objectives recommended by the Commission without toning them down?
It touches on many issues that we agree are of crucial importance, such as the preservation of Kosovo's cultural heritage, the improvement of its public administration capacity, better integration among its communities, the importance of multi-ethnic education, and the plight of Roma families in lead-contaminated refugee camps in the north.
In this context, I also welcome the fact that we have struck a balance with the formula 'no longer equivalent' to an existing food, whilst providing for mechanisms to interpret this criterion precisely.
This question will be answered if we ask ourselves another question, namely, what is weakening Europe today?
I would like to name some of them briefly.
It allows nationals of the Member States to be extradited and it basically abolishes the principle of double jeopardy and the facility for the political leadership to decide on the extradition of an individual, thereby reversing the basic principles and guarantees of protection of individual rights safeguarded under previous extradition law.
There are a number of proposals for legislative acts on the table.
Of course there is a difficulty with the implementation of a common immigration and asylum policy.
However, when we make these decisions, we should bear in mind the political realities in the European Union, so when we vote today, I will have very mixed feelings about whether simply ignoring the vote - the reality in Europe - is really the right thing to do.
Article 2 of our joint motion for a resolution mentions the most recent ones: in Anvers, on 12 May 2006, Oulemata Niangadou was murdered because she was black, together with little Luna for whom she was caring.
When the ministers for agriculture meet and decide on their EUR 45 billion, neither the European Parliament nor any regional or national parliament has any say.

Let me give a specific example.
That proposal was aimed primarily at meeting the Parliament's criticism that the earlier proposal had not gone far enough in establishing a level playing field.
The political mouthpieces of European capital (the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and social democrats and liberals) who voted for the Bolkestein directive in the European Parliament in February 2006, with a new unacceptable compromise in the report on the Commission communication, are stuttering out lukewarm recommendations, thereby facilitating the EU's attempts to direct the workers' movement.
The Commission has also attached the utmost importance to a full and prompt implementation by all parties of UN Security Council Resolution 1559.
That procedure has been completed and we have the result.
This protocol was renewed for a period of two months to avoid a break in fishing activities.
Let me reiterate the common aims of both the American and the European negotiators and the EU Member States.
I simply said that this version was not available.

In the deliberations in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we came up against the problem of defining what is meant by 'family members', and I gather from what I have heard this morning that we were not alone in doing so.
Mr President, to follow on from what my two colleagues have just said, I took part in the adoption of this directive with Mrs Corbey and others.
These are issues that go far beyond science and technology policy.

Then there was the question of reactor safety and the prevention of future accidents.
I agree that, within the law and with respect for the freedom of expression, the terrorist propaganda aimed at encouraging terrorist acts must be prevented.
It is expected that the newer EU Member States will reduce their CO2 emissions by 21% by 2010.
This task applies to all Community policy right across the board and must also be given considerably greater consideration in the special financial promotion programmes of the European Union, whether within the Community or in programmes in third countries, since the necessary resources for the breakthrough campaign alone will cost the public coffers an estimated ECU 4 billion.
It is indicative of the high quality of the Commission’s proposal, which, on the back of past results, has set more ambitious objectives for the new programme.
This means that they are greatly lacking in financial resources, but there is more to the matter in practice.
It should be, however, because we are underestimating the importance of this matter.
The developed countries and the rapidly developing economies also jointly acknowledged that the stability and prosperity of poor countries and the most vulnerable social groups everywhere in the world are in the interests of everyone.
The rapporteur's proposal mentions the fact that the UN is looking for 'the establishment of new bodies, the radical overhaul of others, the reshaping of the management of its ground operations, the reorganisation of its assistance delivery and an in-depth reform of its Secretariat'.
Nevertheless, since the financial markets remain vulnerable, there is a need to create, parallel to the establishment of this large market, regulatory authorities vested with wide powers, not to intervene on a routine basis but to take action when the rules of common sense have been breached by players in the field.
The explanation was really very difficult and the six founding countries said that this is our neighbour. We must take into account that we have not been able to build or maintain adequate relations with this great country and that we do not want to leave it with a siege feeling, a kind of permanent siege.
This is why it is also extremely important for control and sanctions to be harmonised at international level.
One key aspect that was widely acknowledged during the debate was education and training.
Signing agreements when organising public transport services is the correct procedure in cases where such agreements enjoy public subsidy.

All the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater European involvement in the peace process.
According to recent figures, the world's population is steadily increasing, and it is thought that it will increase by around 40% by 2050, creating an increase in demand for food which is expected to double current requirements.
How can we explain to our public today that a football entering the European market produced under decent working conditions, where the environment is respected, and a football produced by child labour or in a country where trade unions are prohibited is the same football?
I am not able to support most of the amendments tabled by the Liberals and Greens, with two exceptions, but we can go along with most of the PSE’s amendments and I would ask for your support for our ten amendments.
I always found his advice to be wise, measured, considered and not dogmatic, and I wish him, in particular, a very successful future.
Today, it is possible for anyone who so wishes to origin-mark his or her goods, and, believe me, any competitive company that can envisage gaining customers in this way will already be doing this, so it is not needed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The first is that the report on the 2012 budget is based on the assumption of enhanced economic governance involving the EU, the European Semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment.
China has an appalling record of inappropriate and wide-scale use of the death penalty, persecution of religious and other minorities, such as unregistered Christian groups, Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, etc. However, its inhumane treatment of forced labour prisoners, including allegations of organ trafficking from those executed, poor standards of animal welfare and ignoring of ILO standards, also mean that it has an unfair competitive cost advantage in its exports, which will give rise to legitimate calls for more protectionism, when we should all be striving instead for global free trade.
That costs money but it has to be done.
At last!
Mrs Colombo Svevo is quite correct when she says we must reach agreement.
In some aspects of the resolution the rapporteur has tried - although in my opinion this was not part of his remit - to keep all four current beneficiary Member States in the Cohesion Fund beyond the year 1999.

That in itself will bring down prices.
The Commission could provide considerable impetus here, but the Council in its wisdom has decided to keep the standing committee on Schengen implementation.
This is the only way we can ensure that we shall proceed with the scheduled investments, which are vital and urgent, and also carry out the reconstruction work which is even more vital and urgent. If we fail to do so, either we shall retard irremediably our progress towards reaching the average development parameters for our country and the European Union, or we shall not carry out any reconstruction work.
- Before the vote on Amendment 9:
Mr President, when an oil tanker sinks, we are all very well aware, firstly, of how serious a situation it is, of its environmental impact and of the need to respond in a joint fashion.
An international transaction tax on the globalised financial sector is the best way to fund international objectives in areas such as development aid and climate change.
Madam President, I am very sorry but there is no card there.
The EU should denounce this example, loud and clear, as an example of the extraterritorial application of national legislation.
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for this, since throughout its mandate it has shown courage and vision, as well as the Commissioner responsible for these issues.
I shall confine myself to dealing with two issues concerning international relations, which will certainly also be discussed in Dublin by the Heads of State and Government and by the Foreign Ministers.
Nevertheless, we now have the phenomenon of global crime, which is of a cross-border nature, such as terrorism, drug-trafficking, smuggling, sexual exploitation and pornography.

When voting on Mrs Müller' s excellent report, on which we must congratulate her, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy included vitamins and minerals in the definition of food supplements, as well as other substances listed in the annexes.
This demonstrates the widespread use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, and I must say that European farmers have had enough of being the only ones to adopt and comply with the rules at the risk of a drop in their incomes.
Fifteen years on from this historic UN conference, the assessment of the efforts made to improve the situation of women in the world is disappointing.
Violation of freedom of expression and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in Lithuania (vote)
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that obviously cannot be clarified in the way you mean.
We should be optimistic and thankful for what we have achieved.
I cannot see because I have my back to it, you understand.
The European Parliament report, despite its faults, does at times seem to see the dangers of the new system and is alarmed by them.
Since we are all engaged in supporting the Lisbon strategy – maybe with differing degrees of enthusiasm – success in achieving such a knowledge-based, dynamic and competitive economy is not going to be propelled by hesitancy in the further development of the single market, by false economies with reduced public and private sector investment, or by a ceiling on the financial perspectives which disables European Union engagement in research and development, regional development and efforts to combat poverty and under-development throughout the world.
On average, women earn 17.4% less than men, they are at the greatest risk of poverty and, especially in old age, they are hard hit not only by loneliness and a reliance on care, but also poverty.
In conclusion, I can assure you that I am closely monitoring trends in food prices and I want to work in the future in consultation with you, here, in Parliament, and with the Council, on this issue, so as to come forward with concrete proposals, first and foremost with the reform of the common agricultural policy, but also with other, more specific, instruments.
Every region and citizen must have access to the basics of the information network.
And why does it not activate the safety clause for which provision is made in China's WTO accession protocol?
Mr President, I would like to make a simple technical correction that does not alter this report in any way.
With this background, an impartial monitoring mechanism, even on a small-scale, would be in the interests of both parties as a means of ensuring full implementation of the Tenet plan and the full and immediate application of the recommendations of the Mitchell Commission, respecting its deadlines and the planned order of events.
Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there.
Conversely, unfair commercial practices lead to irrational financial behaviour in consumers, create distortions of competition and place barriers in the way of the proper functioning of the market.
The President declared the common position approved as amended
I think our agreement on 'individual financing' was a great success.
That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask for your massive support for Amendment No 64 to Article 26, which states that the interim ban on feeding animals all kinds of animal by-products must not be extended to the date on which this regulation enters into force, as is the Commission' s wish, but to the date on which this regulation is fully implemented in the Member States.
I would like to end by thanking Parliament once again and in particular the three rapporteurs and the delegation which has participated in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission within this informal tripartite dialogue which we have carried out and for the constructive work they have done with regard to all these measures.
Nevertheless, I wish to insist on the fact that it is untrue that this regulation will result in a kind of Russian roulette for consumers, and that it is irresponsible propaganda to claim that something better can be secured if the joint text is rejected.
The question always concerns the standards on which the tests will be based, as allegedly none of the 17 German reactors would be approved today, simply because the standards which applied when they were built do not meet current requirements.
We can therefore see in these circumstances that it is premature to envisage opening up accession negotiations with Romania.
You have all heard this, you heard it just now.

This is, however, considered in a new Commission proposal on ambient air quality.
Thank you, Mr Marín!

By a majority or unanimously?
The Galileo Programme is currently moving out of the development and testing phase, which has been a success, and into the implementation phase.
Spain has always been very committed to Europe and has always been very pro-European.
I welcome the adoption of this report today. It raises the issue of the European Union's absorption capacity and specifies, in particular, that, given the current state of the Union's own resources system, any further enlargements could not be funded without the effectiveness of the current cohesion policies being harmed.
Mention is made here of peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks.
In conclusion, I agree with the proposal that candidate cities should be able to submit their candidature directly to the European Commission, and not to their governments.
Police stations are being closed and special units reduced while we are increasingly having to fight ever more unscrupulous criminal gangs rubbing their hands together with glee every time another border opens up.
We should also remember the very substantial progress on the outstanding non-institutional issues made by the Italian presidency, to which I pay tribute.
As Mrs Stauner requested it in her report, this should allow you to take it into account in the discharge resolution.

In the Mediterranean, in particular, this is tolerated, even connived at, by the common fisheries policy, which seems to work in favour of allowing sea resources to be managed, in terms of both orthodox fishing and aquaculture, by the multinationals whose only interest in the fisheries policy is making sure that it suits their ends.
Schools, for good reason, must play a very important role in this regard, although I must also say that I completely agree with the Commission that this is not just the responsibility of the schools.
Maintaining the European economic system was imperative of course, but this must not make us forget the extreme poverty that is raging at our borders; extreme poverty made worse by a crisis for which we carry the burden of responsibility.
I would also like to underline the new principles of employment and payment, which will be transparent and meet the needs announced earlier of assistants and the end of the pension fund in its previous form.
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach.
A further key point will be the approach to, and management of, water resources.
We know that Mr Wibe, coming as he does from a Scandinavian background, is particularly interested in information technology.
And furthermore, we are holding the debate on a Thursday, which is not usual for fisheries, and the reports will be voted on on a Thursday morning.
I do not find it at all boring.
Mr President, when the new Presidency takes up its duties there is usually a solemn atmosphere, but that has been overshadowed this year by the terrible tragedy of the seaquake in South-east Asia.
18.
I am in favour of tough and transparent negotiations, but they should be negotiations nonetheless.
If we concentrate all our services in the European Quarter, it gives real estate developers enormous opportunities to ask very high prices, which we have already seen in many cases.
Those people who know nothing of other languages, those who know nothing of other countries and of other cultures, those people who live, sometimes quite happily, in ignorance, are very often those who are most susceptible to misinformation.
We also agree with the Commission's ethics committee when it says that the human body and elements thereof, as variously constituted and developed, do not constitute an invention able to be patented, as well as its further statement that, where inventions derived from the knowledge of a human gene are concerned, a patent may be issued only where the identification of the function of that gene offers new opportunities and the proposed use of the patent is sufficiently specific and clear.
It is no longer enough to educate for the immediate needs of the workplace.
Their owners feel very bitter that the very low prices they are currently receiving for their pigs are not reflected in the prices of meat in the supermarkets which import meat raised to lower welfare standards.
Moreover, it expresses the intention, in cases of a flagrant violation of European Union waste legislation, of inviting the responsible ministers of the relevant Member States to attend a committee meeting of the European Parliament to explain their policies.
(CS) You asked several questions, each of which needs a complex answer.
I am voting for this report, given that the current partnership agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles has been in force since 2006, and that the protocol for this agreement expired on 17 January 2011.
Mr President, on a point of order, I have to object to the way the questions are being handled.
We recognise that in some firms and sectors the energy cost may be very high as a proportion of total cost and for such firms and such sectors we need a mechanism to recognise and address the competitive handicap.
We know that financial engineering has a considerable imagination when it comes to inventing new financial products to allow some people to escape taxation. This is why Parliament and the Commission propose to introduce a committee procedure that adapts the definition of savings products to the current reality of that financial engineering.
(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
You requested proper consultation with the social partners, the railway sector, but you have also set an example yourselves by consulting everyone properly, with the consequence that we have a product with which we can do something.
In connection with the Employment Pact which Europe is seeking to achieve, it will depend to a great extent on not only bearing in mind the traditional areas of industry or the development of new technologies, but also taking into account in this context the specific problems of rural areas.
I believe that it would not be wise at this stage, since we are working on promoting the directive, to begin amending it.
As the next session of the Council is due to ...
All the' Cologne process' means is getting macro economic dialogue under way, i.e. conducting negotiations between the Council, Commission, social partners and the European Central Bank. Nothing more was achieved.
In particular, recent disasters such as the tunnel fire in Austria as well as earlier fires in restaurants, hotels and ships, etc. highlight the importance of better coordination of fire safety policy in the EU.
The IGC and the Lisbon Informal Council demonstrated that, when European Institutions and Member States cooperate, we are able to solve what seem to be even the most complicated and most challenging problems.
Only in that way can we achieve a general awareness which leads to an organisational transformation and a reduction in transport needs.
There are two possible attitudes one can adopt.
However, it is not just a matter of integrating this approach into the common agricultural policy. The same must be done with the common fisheries policy.
May I ask, then, why the Commission, as the world's biggest competition authority, has never effectively tackled one of the world's biggest restrictive practices, namely the De Beers Diamond Company, as regards the so-called supplier of choice system, which is highly restrictive to competition?
In Poland there are more women who are unemployed than men, particularly in rural areas.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
The Commission's credibility now depends on sharpening the supervision of state aid which is talked about a lot in industry.
Madam President, today we are debating the proposals for reform of the various agricultural sectors without knowing the possible financial impact of such proposals and, above all, whether or not they fit in with the future financial perspective.
However, if this is where we are at now, then it is because, back in 2004, they did not have the courage to give a truly European impetus to the railways.
Are we are saying that the Cyprus question can be resolved without ending the occupation?
Thank you.
Unfortunately, action taken to date in this area has not been transparent and convincing, which may produce unfavourable results for citizens and the economy over the next 15 years.
Today we have a successful energy labelling model on a scale from A to G, where Α is used for the most efficient products and G for the least efficient, a scale which is used today as a standard in many countries outside the European Union.
We must constantly assess where the priority lies according to Europe's historical interests.
In terms of research and genetic manipulation, many of us would support somatic cell repair but might have doubts about somatic cell enhancement or germ cell repair and certainly there will be grave concerns about germ-cell enhancement.
Will these three gentlemen of quite mature years really be able to enthuse people, especially young people, when it comes to the debate about the future?
The border countries alone cannot bear all the responsibilities of the costs and organisation required to deal with asylum applications that often require a great deal of time and long and careful evaluations.
In July 2001 another meeting took place in Genoa and Mr Prodi announced to the world's media a donation of EUR 120 million.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Angola is still suffering from war, destruction and the senseless, shocking loss of human lives.
It will also lead to increased ethnic, cultural and religious diversity.
The rest are illegal and may, for example, involve gangland operations, illicit distilling or smuggling by private individuals who, as the politicians see it, are bringing more than their ration into the country. That is why I am saying that Swedish alcohol policy, which involves charging high prices for alcohol and making it difficult to obtain, has foundered.
The United Kingdom, which together with the United States has an eighty per cent share of the international art market, is one of the four states which never incorporated this right into its legislation.
The EU needs to ensure that common standards and systems facilitate cross-border rail travel and important projects are promoted within the arterial roads.
These are not very helpful.

I shall give it to them very briefly, but you will understand that it is not possible to start a debate on such a question now.
Mr President, please allow me now to make some comments which are going to reiterate what has already been said, because at this point in the debate everything has really been said already.
. – We supported the amendments seeking to improve maritime safety.
The Commission is going to incorporate all these amendments once it has adjusted their wording in accordance with the standardised formulations on comitology agreed between the institutions.
Mr President, above all we need to be aware here today of our responsibilities in Parliament's final part-session, not only our legislative function but our commitment to deliver this new round of European funds for our regions and local communities in a timely manner.
What is also lacking is an understanding of the fact that the EU’s Member States have taken up very different positions as regards the challenges of globalisation.
I think the standstill decision is a good thing.
Therefore, I urge the Commission and the Council to step up their dialogue and the implementation of specific measures as part of their relations with these countries.
We all know what these reprisals are about.
The Commission and Parliament have been working together for over six years now to ensure that workers currently excluded from the working time directive have appropriate protection.
Does that make Europe worse?
No single Member State, no matter which one, can do as it pleases about this, but it must, both before and after 2010, be monitored by the Commission in accordance with the laws on subsidies.
The second is that the people sitting behind the glass screens - the interpreters - also want to go home.
We will be able to make use of these instruments, which will ultimately help to reconcile societies to some degree and to stabilise Europe, only if we, along with our societies and the European public, carry on in the same direction towards the one peaceful and multilateral objective with the help of transatlantic cooperation, an objective that our people expect of us.
Concerns such as peace, security, the fight against terrorism, economic development in our neighbouring countries, the prevention of illegal immigration and energy supplies are all issues that will benefit from an approach that creates allies and includes partners in the South.
Zero tolerance of drivers who commit offences, whether or not drink-drivers, would be more effective in fighting the increase in the number of road accident victims.
The speed at which the countries of the Western Balkans move forward on their way to the EU will depend on the results achieved by each of them in carrying out reforms.
However, I am thinking primarily of consumers.
It is at national level that coherence should be defined for land management, coastal management and maintaining a balance between the various types of fishing - inshore fishing, high-sea fishing, deep-sea fishing - and, moreover, the regions have no desire to take the place of the national authorities on this matter.
Very significant humanitarian aid is therefore being provided to Iraq.
Unfortunately, some of them have also not answered all the questions about their past.
Can the President of the Commission therefore give an assurance that support for research into carbon capture and storage will continue into the future?
At the heart of that compromise is substitution, and the authorisation procedures with their mandatory substitution plans will phase out chemicals of very high concern where safer, viable alternative substances and technologies exist.
However, as with all support policies, two points need to be taken into account here.
But, for many petitioners, it is incomprehensible that it should take so long for their submissions to be considered or for a solution to be found.
These concern the interface between macroeconomic developments and microeconomic solutions and you will find the text in Article 105(6) of the EU Treaty.
Finally, I would like to thank all my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Policy and the whole of the technical team, especially the technical secretariat of the Committee on Regional Policy.
I hope the new Parliament will make that voice heard more loudly and more often, because the tragedy currently unfolding in the Balkans is proof enough that there can never be too many words of warning and incitements to action, not least on the part of a democratically elected forum like the European Parliament.
How?
In other words, swallowing medicines is not the only route to good health.
Mr President, I should like to propose, in agreement with Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, who is the author of this amendment, and being aware that the Socialist Group also has a similar oral amendment, that at the end, after the words ‘trafficking in drugs, arms and human beings’, it should read: ‘and financing through extortion, including the so-called revolutionary tax’.
Otherwise, the beneficiaries of CAP and the whole Community itself would lose a great deal.
We need an internal market - it is our strength - and, at the same time, a high level of social cohesion.
In terms of fishing as well as agriculture, this Europe is isolating us as if we were part of the problem!

I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency's seminar.
In order for humanitarian aid to follow a steady path to its full deployment, we must continue doggedly to argue for the preservation of the 'humanitarian space'.
But it should be a conference at which two things will be determined: first, the agenda for future negotiations, and secondly, and most importantly, the process to enable those negotiations to take place.
The entry into force of the Customs Union has been accompanied by the introduction of enhanced arrangements for political dialogue between the European Union and Turkey.

Recent events like the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of three members of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party and the sentencing of two Sam Rainsy Party members undoubtedly raise scepticism about the commitment of the two parties in power in the coalition government to a genuinely pluralistic democratic system.
Now it is just the political class of these new countries that want to join this new prison of nations, the European Union.
I persist in believing that it would be more judicious to try and prevent conflict situations than to stand by and wait for tragedies to erupt.
These are measures aimed not only at producing social resilience policies, but also at economic diversification in the targeted areas or investment to improve competitiveness.
Thank you, Commissioner Vitorino.
Under the treaty, more effective consultations with local and regional authorities and their associations are required.

There is also a problem in respect of competition, because if the restrictions we are discussing today apply to European companies or pharmacists, we shall see these pharmacists, traders or businesses being put at a competitive disadvantage vis-àvis other countries where such medicines are allowed to circulate freely.
As there are no other speakers, the Commissioner has the floor.
We are therefore convinced that these initiatives, which are already under way, and on which there will have to be a full debate with civil society, with interested parties, with associations representing industry, business and consumers and, of course, with the European Parliament, will enable us to put in place, in the short term, a legal reference framework which will establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.
It stresses the importance of international cooperation, the need for all Member States to participate in space activities and the importance of collaboration with third countries, and points out that the ESA has functioned efficiently and has played a leading role in space research and space applications in both Europe and worldwide.
This sounds drastic, but we can manage with a gradual change if we act consistently.
Dealing with deforestation, the destruction of the forests, clearly forms part of the Spanish Presidency's objectives and we understand that it is necessary to apply some of the instruments which the European Union has at its disposal, for example, the Non-Legally Binding Instrument, on all types of forest, and the European Union's action plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade which, for example, stipulates the creation of a legal framework to prevent the importing of illegally felled wood.

The report also rather passes over the fact that the nation has descended into poverty because a small elite has been clinging onto the nation's wealth.
In view of this, I believe that the text before us will enable the Commission, when acting on a complaint it has received, or on its own initiative, to exercise its prerogatives fully, strengthening significantly its powers, and to determine in each individual case, and at any time, which companies are parent carriers and must shoulder the major obligations arising from that status.
These are the areas where the reforms in Turkey are especially important.

Liberia is just the latest episode in a collective tragedy which appears to have no end - and we cannot remain apart from all this.
National transport issues are a matter for national governments and, accordingly, each Member State should be free to determine its own rules and criteria on drivers' licences.
Mr Mombaur, I would be happy to sign that and ensure that it is duly published as a document of record.
Fourth point: I think the biggest structural problem that we have between ESDP and NATO is that our cooperation does not really work in the way it is supposed to.
We seek to unite peoples and to create greater harmony in European society on a basis of mutual trust and solidarity. ʼNo more nationalism' was the logical reaction after we had conquered national socialism.

We wanted to see that by 2013 our people would be living a little more like ‘first class’ Europe.
I think that in institutional terms, it is an extremely serious matter that we are moving towards replacing collegiate decisions, which the European Union is bound to observe under the Treaty, by means of bilateral decisions between governments.
This is why I support the report by Mrs Rosbach, which draws up new indicators taking account of major strands of environmental policy such as energy use, biodiversity, water use and waste generation.

Restoring the balance in the Baltic is a measure to which exceptional priority should be given.
Mr Duisenberg, I remember last year' s discussion on the 1998 annual report very clearly.

Where should the vertebral column be removed.
We enjoy a very considerable privilege.

Draft agreement with South Africa (B4-0222/99)

Indeed, Mr Niall Crowley, Chief Executive Officer of Ireland's Equality Authority, has resigned as CEO stating 'the Equality Authority has been rendered unviable by the decision [...] to cut its funding by 43% and to continue the decentralisation of its staff' and that '[T]he work of the Equality Authority has been fatally compromised'.

Question No 10 by Jonas Sjöstedt, which has been taken over by Herman Schmid.
Therefore, today we have an area that accepts anyone who meets all the criteria laid down in the Treaty.

Madam President, this Parliament has been calling for General Pinochet to be put on trial for a very long time.
Women participate at all levels of our country and the leaders of my country, including the President, call upon the participation of women in all fields of society.
The reform of the European institutions would also help to bring about broader publicity at European level, which we sorely need.
This would be an improvement on the Council’s common position, which provides for a national enforcement strategy and a national point of contact with the other Member States.
Pregnancies are always full of suspense, of course - you always wonder whether the child will be born perfectly healthy - but I can honestly say that in neither of those pregnancies did I ever wonder whether I myself would survive.
We saw the debate begun a couple of years ago by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, about whether humanitarian intervention was sometimes justified, for example when a sovereign government could be accused of assaulting the interests and the liberties and the rights of its own people.
We have looked at and reviewed Commission proposals, made sure they are workable and politically acceptable across our countries, and got a solution which I am sure will bring huge benefits to the EU economy.

The situation in both countries has escalated during the past two months.

On donor consent, I pointed out that the proposal states that the use of human tissues and cells should take place under conditions protecting the rights and health of all parties, and that the consent of donors and recipients should be given, following the International Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.

What was that we were saying about a single European voice?
The fault for not securing progress in that respect is certainly not that of the Commission.
As regards new networks, these were absent from the Commission proposal, or poorly addressed, at a time when Europe is already involved in this technological revolution.
At present, as was rightly mentioned by Mrs Trüpel, it gives direct access to 7 million digitised objects.
If you have an opportunity to comment, Commissioner, that may be useful.
As a historical optimist, I choose the latter point of view in case of doubt.
Of course, there have to be incentives for the industry and a certain amount of pressure still has to be exerted to get money invested in finding alternatives, as otherwise the money will be paid out only to the directors when we believe it could also be invested in science.
That would be the answer.
The real response to the crisis lies in giving value to work and in a fairer distribution of income, namely through taxation, thus benefiting work as opposed to capital.
That is the situation we socialists desire, but it can only be achieved if Iran meets its international commitments, beginning with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The logical approach is to make all the appointments on the basis of Nice or all on the basis of Lisbon.
We are actively ensuring that this legislation is applied across the EU.
We must pursue the moratorium since the revised 90/220 Directive does not meet all the requirements that we stipulated at the beginning.
We will have to consider how it is going to be done.
Firstly, when we speak to applicants for European research funds, the motto seems to be "frustration not administration' , because many selection procedures are non-transparent and rejections are not explained.
Contrary to last year, however, there may well be spending requirements if current developments on some markets are confirmed.
This report notes that sound financial discipline and transparency in the allocation of funds are key preconditions for achieving cohesion policy's overall objectives, contributing towards increasing accountability as regards strategic objectives.
That is exclusively for the Member States.
This is not a one-off campaign; as some of the rapporteurs have already said, this is a process which is both deep and far-reaching and is being pursued consistently.
With the United States, we can now move to that 30% target and beyond.
We have to look at the agricultural and trade policies that are destroying small and medium-sized agriculture, that promote models of intensive production for export and that, in this way, threaten food security and sovereignty; as is the case with the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The Commission has given its blessing to cartels formed between EU airlines and thus given its approval to the formation of cartels in this sector.
Some of them have no weekend duty staff.

What are the next steps after you vote tomorrow and after the Council's decision of 16 December?
However, I wish to take up certain parts of it that deal with trading in emissions rights.

This would then be the exact date. It is a small thing, but we should be true to the facts.
We must work together to explain what we do more effectively.
Would the rapporteur like to say something about this?
Let me thank Parliament for this vital support for these two valuable reports in favour of the proposals for the conclusion of these agreements.
All relevant actors across sectors need to work together to make the strategy a success.
(Applause)

We are aware that the task we will have to carry out between now and the deadline of 12-13 December is sensitive and complex.
Thank you very much, Mr President, for the opportunity to speak.
Madam President, please excuse me, but what I have to say does not concern the Minutes.
We mark the 20th anniversary today of the adoption by this European Parliament of the first draft Constitutional Treaty for the European Union and the 25th anniversary of the death of Jean Monnet.
The agreement of the budgetary authority to examine a late rectifying letter will permit the drawing of the appropriate conclusions also for the 1998 budget.
But beyond that, Madam President, I fear that this report wishes to appoint the European Parliament, the European Union as a joint detective agency, inquiring into what is going on and what must happen in Hong Kong as if it were populated by Belgians, Germans, Englishmen, Greeks and other Europeans.
I believe he has contributed to the clarity to which Mrs Berès referred in this Chamber.
The political compromise that has now been reached by the Council is intolerable.
The outcome of the Council's deliberations is also extremely encouraging.
The European Parliament has chosen to have a strong position to negotiate with the Council and has therefore supported the principle of a 20-week period of leave paid at 100% (may I point out that in Sweden, maternity leave can be as long as 75 weeks, with 14 weeks exclusively for the mother, and the remaining can be shared with the father).
On Saturday the President of Ireland said: 'Our continent is ancient but our Union is young'.
It is now immediately obvious to the electorate which Members wish to expose the mismanagement and deception on the part of the present Commission and which Members wish to cover it up or are not interested in it.
Hence the proposals to separate non-profit-making activities from fee systems based on costs.
- After the vote:
When you consider that, along with the point that 80 % of the money is going to 20 % of the farmers, then we have to say that perhaps at the moment it is time - I do not want to decouple it from production entirely - to consider a greater variety of schemes - and certainly now the money can be spread more widely.
So I welcome the fact that the report takes a most positive view of this contribution from the European structural funds both to Objective 1 regions and to improving the situation in the German Objective 2 and 5b areas.
The European Union's growing responsibilities in the world derive in fact from the strength it has now achieved, its tradition of safeguarding peace and human rights, and its concern to see a stable international environment for its commercial activities and its political presence.
The second problem is overfishing.
Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are either sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources.
That is my suggestion, at least, Mr President.
The car industry only has a future if it opts in favour of energy-efficient and non-polluting cars.
Consequently, I am optimistic that the amendments to that first directive, concerning which we have the present common position, will enjoy equally rapid incorporation into national laws.
This is especially true for the very small businesses, the SMEs, which as a result can create a significant number of jobs, and that is precisely what we want.
It is nevertheless true that the enormous dynamic of the Single Market and the increasing commercialisation of sporting activities have caused a number of legal conflicts in this field.
In the end, the overall inclusion of Roma is essentially a question of fundamental rights, even if we have to ask the Roma communities to try and integrate and not to close themselves in their own world where they do not respect European and national laws.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement.
How can anyone understand that?
The proposals for the reform of the common agricultural policy and structural funds are far-reaching and will be extremely painful to many regions of the present European Union.
Are demands of this kind now being made of the applicant countries as part of the accession process?
I would also like to say a word about a subject that is close to our hearts: respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism.
We can appreciate that Members from countries where the health service has collapsed see a hope in the EU, but the payment of tax and thus the financing must continue to take place nationally.
Finally, while the success of the recovery plans must be the priority, an annual review of their progress and socio-economic impact should be undertaken.
A good agricultural policy is one which is based on what the consumer needs, and not on what the producer wants.
GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world.
In the light of these documents and of the political activities of the European Union, has the Council followed, been informed about and studied the consequences of the proposed law in the Netherlands concerning medically-assisted suicides which will be determined in the Dutch Senate on 10 April 2001?
Other questions relate to how we can reduce unemployment among young people and how we can effectively increase the participation of women in the labour market by widening their involvement in every business sector.
As far as the 50% is concerned, I feel I must point out that this objective should never be the be all and end all.
But the Commission wants not only to decentralize but also to ensure that local and regional actors and social partners have a greater involvement in the framing and implementation of the programmes - otherwise decentralization can quickly turn into renationalization.
What none of us can accept, however, is to allow the acknowledged inability of the EU to fulfil its supranational role of ensuring international order and peace to be concealed behind a wall of silence.
Why are we giving a derogation to Papua New Guinea?
I have noted the literary examples that have been given: Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Emperor's New Clothes' and Voltaire's Pangloss who, whatever happens in 'Candide', thinks that all is for the best.
I became aware then of the enormous gulf that lies between our line of thinking and their line of thinking.
The strengthening of the provisions relating to health and consumer protection was not challenged at Amsterdam.
The reform is based on mutual trust and close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Auditors.
With Europe delaying in finding its feet and appearing to be cowardly, weak and, for a long time, to have no voice in the historically important event of the last decade, by which I mean the uprisings in the Arab world, with the Member States failing to take a united stand on the critical UN Security Council Resolution 1973 on Libya, and with the Union hesitating on Syria, I wonder whether perhaps the question has already been answered in practice.
However, I must emphasise that these circumstances should not have come as a surprise to anyone.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry considers that this is an extremely important issue and should be dealt with as a matter of great urgency.
This, of course, should not be at the cost of producers or the end consumer.
He will be receiving an invitation from me to a meeting next week where I have been asked by the Industry Committee to convene a group of interested parliamentarians.
That is to say, a public authority must carry out an assessment to ensure that a medical professional determines what constitutes 'turn' and 'need'.
This can be achieved by using the already existing contact points of the European Judicial Network instead of the proposed national correspondents for Eurojust.
Mr Estievenart was with us last month and pointed out that, and I quote, ‘there are positive signs that progress has been made in reducing some of the worst consequences of drug use’.
As we have said already, human trafficking is perhaps the very worst form of crime.
When we look at the forecasts for growth for next year, we see that the European Union is expected to have an average growth of 0.7%, and Latin America of 5%.
It is forgetting just one thing: this equality is not provided for by Article 202 of the Treaty, which confers the power principally on the Council.
It is the different governments, not just the current ones but also previous ones, that have generated the dynamism in Romania which has, in turn, led to the Commission reaching its conclusion.
Under Article 154 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community is to contribute to the creation and development of trans-European networks in the field of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure.
Cast off your diffidence, Commissioners! In matters of consumer protection, we as a Parliament are right behind the Commission!
The purpose of our proposed amendments is not only to stipulate strict environmental protection requirements but to format these requirements so that they can be transposed and complied with by all Member States.
I should also like to ask the Commissioner if he will ensure that as far as the WTO is concerned, there is full consultation with civil society and NGOs and that labour issues are taken into account?
What information does the Council have concerning Mr Khanbiev's abduction?
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that child sex offenders have a high repeat offence rate.
We must adopt a wide-ranging approach that considers how to deal with, prevent and recover from disasters, so it is important we ask the Commission to urgently present proposals to prevent disasters in the European Union.
It is important to have safe roads and this Parliament has decided to take, together with the Commission, certain decisions relating to infrastructure, but the main problem is educating those who sit behind the driver's wheel or on a motorbike saddle.
An important milestone at Tampere was reached when it was decided to continue with the convergence of civil law and civil process law, for better cooperation and legal protection.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, it is well over eighteen months, Mr Prodi, since you announced that the reform of European governance was one of the Commission's four strategic objectives.
I will leave this view for what it is.
We must not repeat the terrible human destruction that caused the tragic silent spring so well described by Rachel Carson years back. Please let us fulfil the Fifth Action Programme in one go.
However, it is also essential to denounce the aggressors and hold them responsible.
Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries
Do fundamental rights not count any more?
Fourthly, we must increase the supply of oil and gas.
But I also confess that it was such a complicated vote that I lost sight of some of the amendments that my committee - the Economic Committee - had been responsible for.
Whilst the Community budget is short of meeting our daily needs, why throw taxpayers’ money down the drain on research that will never have any tangible benefit?
The Council does not therefore see what we have seen, which is that as a follow-up to European legislation it is necessary to have structures to monitor and take fast action in the event of a problem.
Now global information is what counts, and we have left the geographical boundaries of the nation state.
Mr President - yes, thank you very much for your enthusiasm! - I can also tell you that in its common position the Council has been persuaded of the wisdom of many of our astute proposals from the first reading.
The decision on VAT on labour-intensive services is all very well, but in the meantime we still have the Monti proposals, the Primarolo proposals as our staple fare, if I can put it like that.
In view of our history, I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues.
At the very least, the circumstances which led to the ban need to be examined critically.
We must do this or risk compromising our future.

I think it is an affront to them to try and introduce, or give official character to, these symbols.
It looks bad to reintroduce, almost unchanged, a directive that Parliament has already rejected and, so to speak, throw it down before your successor and the House.
I believe that it is absolutely essential.
It was an unedifying example of the richer countries bullying the poorer ones and has prompted many to assert that the so-called victory in Doha was a failure for democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to begin my speech on Trans-European Networks in the energy sector by reminding you once again and quite forcefully, that energy is not a product like any other and that the market cannot be the main force regulating it.
I recognise that what he has done is lay down the gauntlet to Parliament to get its act together on carrying out assessments of its own amendments.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission recognises the risk that feed imports may become more difficult and more expensive, due to asynchronous approvals of GMOs in exporting countries and in the EU.
You are aware that if this initiative is approved, as I hope it will be, and after the Member States have been notified, the matter will pass automatically to the Commission for negotiation, with greater speed and effectiveness than at present.
The European institutions can and must support the governments of Member States in this difficult process.
Sometimes it was small garage paint-shops, sometimes it was domestic use of paint, sometimes it was other substances in other places.
Europe has achieved these results firstly through Galileo, which has given us the opportunity to create the first European mixed investment company, in other words, a joint company that will support an industrial and technological project.
Szabolcs Fazakas: 267 votes
This morning' s debate was about adding Norway, and the countries of Eastern Europe of course, to the centre' s list of members, or that is how the Commission saw it at any rate.
You deserve our thanks, Commissioner Vitorino.
It will have therefore taken the European institutions barely four months to prepare and approve this legislative package.
The Commission says: ‘the worst delays concern rail projects and cross-frontier links which limit the possibilities created by the opening of the railway market.
